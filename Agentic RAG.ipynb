fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP); on a per capita income basis, India ranked 136th by GDP (nominal) and 119th by GDP (PPP).[53] From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments followed the Soviet model and promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive Sovietization, state intervention, demand-side economics, natural resources, bureaucrat-driven enterprises and economic regulation. This is characterised as dirigism, in the form of the Licence Raj.[54][55] The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India and indicative planning.[56][57] India has about 1,900 public sector companies,[58] with the Indian state having complete control and ownership of railways and highways. The Indian government has major control over banking,[59] insurance,[60] farming,[61] fertilizers and chemicals,[62] airports,[63] essential utilities.[64] The state also exerts substantial control over digitalization, telecommunication, supercomputing, space, port and shipping industries,[65] which were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s but has seen the emergence of key corporate players.[54][55][66]\\nNearly 70% of India\\'s GDP is driven by domestic consumption;[67] the country remains the world\\'s fourth-largest consumer market.[68] Aside private consumption, India\\'s GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports.[69] In 2022, India was the world\\'s 10th-largest importer and the 8th-largest exporter.[70] India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[71] It ranks 63rd on the ease of doing business index and 40th on the Global Competitiveness Index.[72][73] India has one of the world\\'s highest number of billionaires along with extreme income inequality.[74][75]  Economists and social scientists often consider India a welfare state.[76][77][78][79] India\\'s overall social welfare spending stood at 8.6% of GDP in 2021-22, which is much lower than the average for OECD nations.[80][81] With 586 million workers, the Indian labour force is the world\\'s second-largest.[82] Despite having some of the longest working hours, India has one of the lowest workforce productivity levels in the world.[83][84][85][86][87] Economists say that due to structural economic problems, India is experiencing jobless economic growth.[88]\\nDuring the Great Recession, the economy faced a mild slowdown. India endorsed Keynesian policy and initiated stimulus measures (both fiscal and monetary) to boost growth and generate demand. In subsequent years, economic growth revived.[89]\\nIn 2021–22, the foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was $82\\xa0billion. The leading sectors for FDI inflows were the Finance, Banking, Insurance and R&D.[90] India has free trade agreements with several nations and blocs, including ASEAN, SAFTA, Mercosur, South Korea, Japan, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and several others which are in effect or under negotiating stage.[91][92]\\nThe service sector makes up more than 50% of GDP and remains the fastest growing sector, while the industrial sector and the agricultural sector employs a majority of the labor force.[93] The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange are some of the world\\'s largest stock exchanges by market capitalisation.[94] India is the world\\'s sixth-largest manufacturer, representing 2.6% of global manufacturing output.[95] Nearly 65% of India\\'s population is rural,[96] and contributes about 50% of India\\'s GDP.[97] India faces high unemployment, rising income inequality, and a drop in aggregate demand.[98][99] India\\'s gross domestic savings rate stood at 29.3% of GDP in 2022.[100]\\n\\n\\nHistory\\nMain articles: Economic history of India and Timeline of the economy of the Indian subcontinent\\nFor a continuous duration of nearly 1700 years from the year 1 CE, India was the world\\'s largest economy, constituting 35 to 40% of the world GDP.[101] The combination of protectionist, import-substitution, Fabian socialism, and social democratic-inspired policies governed India for sometime after the end of British rule. The economy was then characterised as Dirigism,[54][55] It had extensive regulation, protectionism, public ownership of large monopolies, pervasive corruption and slow growth.[56][57][102] Since 1991, continuing economic liberalisation has moved the country towards a market-based economy.[56][57] By 2008, India had established itself as one of the world\\'s faster-growing economies.\\n\\nAncient and medieval eras\\nIndus Valley Civilisation\\nThe citizens of the Indus Valley civilisation, a permanent settlement that flourished between 2800\\xa0BCE and 1800\\xa0BCE, practised agriculture, domesticated animals, used uniform weights and measures, made tools and weapons, and traded with other cities. Evidence of well-planned streets, a drainage system, and water supply reveals their knowledge of urban planning, which included the first-known urban sanitation systems and the existence of a form of municipal government.[103]\\n\\nWest Coast\\nMaritime trade was carried out extensively between southern regions of India and Southeast Asia and West Asia from early times until around the fourteenth century CE. Both the Malabar and Coromandel Coasts were the sites of important trading centres from as early as the first century BCE, used for import and export as well as transit points between the Mediterranean region and southeast Asia.[104] Over time, traders organised themselves into associations which received state patronage. This state patronage for overseas trade came to an end by the thirteenth century CE, when it was largely taken over by the local Parsi, Jewish, Syrian Christian, and Muslim communities, initially on the Malabar and subsequently on the Coromandel coast.[105]\\n\\nSilk Route\\nOther scholars suggest trading from India to West Asia and Eastern Europe was active between the 14th and 18th centuries.[106][107][108] During this period, Indian traders settled in Surakhani, a suburb of greater Baku, Azerbaijan. These traders built a Hindu temple, which suggests commerce was active and prosperous for Indians by the 17th century.[109][110][111][112]\\nFurther north, the Saurashtra and Bengal coasts played an important role in maritime trade, and the Gangetic plains and the Indus valley housed several centres of river-borne commerce. Most overland trade was carried out via the Khyber Pass connecting the Punjab region with Afghanistan and onward to the Middle East and Central Asia.[113] Although many kingdoms and rulers issued coins, barter was prevalent. Villages paid a portion of their agricultural produce as revenue to the rulers, while their craftsmen received a part of the crops at harvest time for their services.[114]\\n\\nSilver coin of the Maurya Empire, 3rd century BCESilver coin of the Gupta dynasty, 5th century CE\\nMughal, Rajput, and Maratha eras (1526–1820)\\nSee also: Muslin trade in Bengal and Economy of the Kingdom of Mysore\\nThe Indian economy was the largest and most prosperous throughout world history and would continue to be under the Mughal Empire, up until the 18th century.[115] Sean Harkin estimates that China and India may have accounted for 60 to 70 percent of world GDP in the 17th century. The Mughal economy functioned on an elaborate system of coined currency, land revenue and trade. Gold, silver and copper coins were issued by the royal mints which functioned on the basis of free coinage.[116] The political stability and uniform revenue policy resulting from a centralized administration under the Mughals, coupled with a well-developed internal trade network, ensured that India–before the arrival of the British–was to a large extent economically unified, despite having a traditional agrarian economy characterised by a predominance of subsistence agriculture.[117] Agricultural production increased under Mughal agrarian reforms,[115] with Indian agriculture being advanced compared to Europe at the time, such as the widespread use of the seed drill among Indian peasants before its adoption in European agriculture,[118] and possibly higher per-capita agricultural output and standards of consumption than 17th century Europe.[119]\\nThe Mughal Empire had a thriving industrial manufacturing economy, with India producing about 25% of the world\\'s industrial output up until 1750,[120] making it the most important manufacturing centre in international trade.[121] Manufactured goods and cash crops from the Mughal Empire were sold throughout the world. Key industries included textiles, shipbuilding, and steel, and processed exports included cotton textiles, yarns, thread, silk, jute products, metalware, and foods such as sugar, oils and butter.[115] Cities and towns boomed under the Mughal Empire, which had a relatively high degree of urbanization for its time, with 15% of its population living in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the urban population in contemporary Europe at the time and higher than that of British India in the 19th century.[122]\\nIn early modern Europe, there was significant demand for products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, as well as goods such as spices, peppers, indigo, silks, and saltpeter (for use in munitions).[115] European fashion, for example, became increasingly dependent on Mughal Indian textiles and silks. From the late 17th century to the early 18th century, Mughal India accounted for 95% of British imports from Asia, and the Bengal Subah province alone accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia.[123] In contrast, there was very little demand for European goods in Mughal India, which was largely self-sufficient.[115] Indian goods, especially those from Bengal, were also exported in large quantities to other Asian markets, such as Indonesia and Japan.[124] At the time, Mughal Bengal was the most important centre of cotton textile production.[125]\\nIn the early 18th century the Mughal Empire declined, as it lost western, central and parts of south and north India to the Maratha Empire, which integrated and continued to administer those regions.[126] The decline of the Mughal Empire led to decreased agricultural productivity, which in turn negatively affected the textile industry.[127] The subcontinent\\'s dominant economic power in the post-Mughal era was the Bengal Subah in the east., which continued to maintain thriving textile industries and relatively high real wages.[128] However, the former was devastated by the Maratha invasions of Bengal[129][130] and then British colonization in the mid-18th century.[128] After the loss at the Third Battle of Panipat, the Maratha Empire disintegrated into several confederate states, and the resulting political instability and armed conflict severely affected economic life in several parts of the country – although this was mitigated by localised prosperity in the new provincial kingdoms.[126] By the late eighteenth century, the British East India Company had entered the Indian political theatre and established its dominance over other European powers. This marked a determinative shift in India\\'s trade, and a less-powerful effect on the rest of the economy.[131]\\n\\nBritish era (1793–1947)\\nMain articles: Economy of India under Company rule and Economy of India under the British Raj\\n There is no doubt that our grievances against the British Empire had a sound basis. As the painstaking statistical work of the Cambridge historian Angus Maddison has shown, India\\'s share of world income collapsed from 22.6% in 1700, almost equal to Europe\\'s share of 23.3% at that time, to as low as 3.8% in 1952. Indeed, at the beginning of the 20th century, \"the brightest jewel in the British Crown\" was the poorest country in the world in terms of per capita income.\\n—\\u200aManmohan Singh[132]\\nThe global contribution to world\\'s GDP by major economies from 1 CE to 2003 CE according to Angus Maddison\\'s estimates.[133] Up until the 18th century, China and India were the two largest economies by GDP output.\\nFrom the beginning of the 19th century, the British East India Company\\'s gradual expansion and consolidation of power brought a major change in taxation and agricultural policies, which tended to promote commercialisation of agriculture with a focus on trade, resulting in decreased production of food crops, mass impoverishment and destitution of farmers, and in the short term, led to numerous famines.[134] The economic policies of the British Raj caused a severe decline in the handicrafts and handloom sectors, due to reduced demand and dipping employment.[135] After the removal of international restrictions by the Charter of 1813, Indian trade expanded substantially with steady growth.[136] The result was a significant transfer of capital from India to Britain, which, due to the colonial policies of the British, led to a massive drain of revenue rather than any systematic effort at modernisation of the domestic economy.[137] The economy of the Indian subcontinent was the largest in the world for most of recorded history up until the onset of colonialism in early 19th century.[133][138][139]\\n\\nEstimated GDP per capita of India and United Kingdom during 1700–1950 in 1990 US$according to Maddison.[140] However, Maddison\\'s estimates for 18th-century India have been criticized as gross underestimates,[141] Bairoch estimates India had a higher GDP per capita in the 18th century,[142][143] and Parthasarathi\\'s findings show higher real wages in 18th-century Bengal and Mysore.[144][120] But there is consensus that India\\'s per capita GDP and income stagnated during the colonial era, starting in the late 18th century.[145]\\nUnder British rule, India\\'s share of the world economy declined from 24.4% in 1700 down to 4.2% in 1950. India\\'s GDP (PPP) per capita was stagnant during the Mughal Empire and began to decline prior to the onset of British rule.[138] India\\'s share of global industrial output declined from 25% in 1750 down to 2% in 1900.[120] At the same time, Britain\\'s share of the world economy rose from 2.9% in 1700 up to 9% in 1870. The British East India Company, following their conquest of Bengal in 1757, had forced open the large Indian market to British goods, which could be sold in India without tariffs or duties, compared to local Indian producers who were heavily taxed, while in Britain protectionist policies such as bans and high tariffs were implemented to restrict Indian textiles from being sold there, whereas raw cotton was imported from India without tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton and sold them back to the Indian market. British economic policies gave them a monopoly over India\\'s large market and cotton resources.[146][147][148] India served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers and a large captive market for British manufactured goods.[149]\\nBritish territorial expansion in India throughout the 19th century created an institutional environment that, on paper, guaranteed property rights among the colonisers, encouraged free trade, and created a single currency with fixed exchange rates, standardised weights and measures and capital markets within the company-held territories. It also established a system of railways and telegraphs, a civil service that aimed to be free from political interference, a common-law, and an adversarial legal system.[150] This coincided with major changes in the world economy\\xa0– industrialisation, and significant growth in production and trade. However, at the end of colonial rule, India inherited an economy that was one of the poorest in the developing world,[151] with industrial development stalled, agriculture unable to feed a rapidly growing population, a largely illiterate and unskilled labour force, and extremely inadequate infrastructure.[152]\\nThe 1872 census revealed that 91.3% of the population of the region constituting present-day India resided in villages.[153] This was a decline from the earlier Mughal era, when 85% of the population resided in villages and 15% in urban centres under Akbar\\'s reign in 1600.[154] Urbanisation generally remained sluggish in British India until the 1920s, due to the lack of industrialisation and absence of adequate transportation. Subsequently, the policy of discriminating protection (where certain important industries were given financial protection by the state), coupled with the Second World War, saw the development and dispersal of industries, encouraging rural-urban migration, and in particular, the large port cities of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras grew rapidly. Despite this, only one-sixth of India\\'s population lived in cities by 1951.[155]\\nThe effect of British rule on India\\'s economy is a controversial topic. Leaders of the Indian independence movement and economic historians have blamed colonial rule for India\\'s poor economic performance following independence and argued that the capital required for the Industrial Revolution in Britain came from India. At the same time, other historians have countered that India\\'s poor economic performance was due to various sectors being in a state of growth and decline due to changes brought in by colonialism and a world that was moving towards industrialisation and economic integration.[156]\\nSeveral economic historians have argued that Indian real wages declined in the early 19th century, or possibly beginning in the very late 18th century, largely as a result of British colonial rule. According to Prasannan Parthasarathi and Sashi Sivramkrishna, the grain wages of Indian weavers were likely comparable to that of their British counterparts and their average income was around five times the subsistence level, which was comparable to advanced parts of Europe.[157][158] However they concluded that due to the scarcity of data, it was hard to draw definitive conclusions and that more research was required.[121][158] It has also been argued that India went through a period of deindustrialization in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect outcome of the collapse of the Mughal Empire.[120]\\n\\nPre-liberalisation period (1947–1991)\\nNavi Mumbai built during pre-liberalization\\nMain articles: Five-Year Plans of India, Economic policy of the Indira Gandhi government, and Licence Raj\\nIndian economic policy after independence was influenced by the colonial experience, which was seen as exploitative by Indian leaders exposed to the planned economy of the Soviet Union.[152] Domestic policy tended towards protectionism, with a strong emphasis on import substitution industrialisation, economic interventionism, a large government-run public sector, business regulation, and central planning,[159] while trade and foreign investment policies were relatively liberal.[160] Five-Year Plans of India resembled central planning in the Soviet Union. Steel, mining, machine tools, telecommunications, insurance, and power plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s.[66] The Indian economy of this period is characterised as Dirigism.[54][55]\\n\\nChange in per capita GDP of India, 1820–2015.

They expected favourable outcomes from their strategy, involving the rapid development of heavy industry by both public and private sectors, and based on direct and indirect state intervention, rather than the more extreme Soviet-style central command system.[164][165] The policy of concentrating simultaneously on capital- and technology-intensive heavy industry and subsidising manual, low-skill cottage industries was criticised by economist Milton Friedman, who thought it would waste capital and labour, and retard the development of small manufacturers.[166]\\n\\n I cannot decide how much to borrow, what shares to issue, at what price, what wages and bonus to pay, and what dividend to give.

The reforms did away with the Licence Raj, reduced tariffs and interest rates and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of foreign direct investment in many sectors.[171] Since then, the overall thrust of liberalisation has remained the same, although no government has tried to take on powerful lobbies such as trade unions and farmers, on contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies.[172] This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates, and food security, although urban residents have benefited more than rural residents.[173]\\n\\nGDP grows exponentially, almost doubling every 8-9 years.\\nIndian GDP growth rate from 1985 to 2024, compared to that of China\\nFrom 2010, India has risen from ninth-largest to the fifth-largest economies in the world by nominal GDP in 2019 by surpassing UK, France, Italy and Brazil.[174]\\nIndia started recovery in 2013–14 when the GDP growth rate accelerated to 6.4% from the previous year\\'s 5.5%.

fishing\\nMain articles: Agriculture in India, Forestry in India, Animal husbandry in India, Fishing in India, and Natural resources in India\\nAgriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted for 18.4% of the GDP,[9] the sector employed 51.2 crore persons or 45.5% of the workforce in India are employed in agriculture.[196][197] India is major agriculture producing country and has the most arable land in the world followed by the United States.[198] However, agricultural output lags far behind its potential.[199] Agriculture\\'s contribution to GDP has steadily declined from 1951 to 2023, shifting from 52% to 15% of India\\'s GDP[200][201] yet it is still the country\\'s largest employment provider sector .[196] Crop-yield-per-unit-area of all crops has grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since the Green Revolution in India. However, international comparisons reveal the average yield in India is generally 30% to 50% of the highest average yield in the world.[202] The states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, West Bengal, Gujarat and Maharashtra are key contributors to Indian agriculture.\\nIndia receives an average annual rainfall of 1,208 millimetres (47.6\\xa0in) and a total annual precipitation of 4,000 billion cubic metres, with the total utilisable water resources, including surface and groundwater, amounting to 1,123 billion cubic metres.[203] 546,820 square kilometres (211,130\\xa0sq\\xa0mi) of the land area, or about 39% of the total cultivated area, is irrigated.[204] India\\'s inland water resources and marine resources provide employment to nearly 6 million people in the fisheries sector. In 2023, according to the Ministry of Fisheries, India is the 3rd largest fish producing and 2nd largest aquaculture producing nation in the world.\\n\\nIndia exports more than 100,000 tonnes (98,000 long tons; 110,000 short tons) of processed cashew kernels every year. There are more than 600 cashew processing units in Kollam alone.[205]\\nIndia is the largest producer of milk, jute and pulses, and has the world\\'s largest cattle population with 303 million animals in 2023.[206] It is the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton and groundnuts, as well as the second-largest fruit and vegetable producer, accounting for 10.9% and 8.6% of the world fruit and vegetable production, respectively, but only for 1% of global fruits and vegetables trade. India is also the second-largest producer and the largest consumer of silk, producing 77,000 tonnes (76,000 long tons; 85,000 short tons) in 2005.[207] India is the second-largest exporter of cashew kernels and cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL). Foreign exchange earned by the country through the export of cashew kernels during FY 2023 reached 356M$. 76,624 tonnes (75,414 long tons; 84,464 short tons) of kernels were exported during 2023.[208] There are about 600 cashew processing units in Kollam, Kerala.[205]\\nIndia\\'s foodgrain production stagnant at approximately 316 megatonnes (311\\xa0million long tons; 348\\xa0million short tons) during 2020–21.[209] India exports several agriculture products, such as Basmati rice, wheat, cereals, spices, fresh fruits, dry fruits, cotton, tea, coffee, milk products and other cash crops to the Asian, African and other countries.[210]\\n\\nSugarcane weighing at a Pravara Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd in Maharashtra\\nThe low productivity in India is a result of several factors. Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs, price risks and uncertainty, and governmental intervention in labour, land, and credit are hurting the market. Infrastructure such as rural roads, electricity, ports, food storage, retail markets and services remain inadequate.[211] The average size of land holdings is very small, with 70% of holdings being less than one hectare (2.5 acres) in size.[212] Irrigation facilities are inadequate, as revealed by the fact that only 46% of the total cultivable land was irrigated as of 2016,[update][204] resulting in farmers still being dependent on rainfall, specifically the monsoon season, which is often inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country.[213] In an effort to bring an additional 20,000,000 hectares (49,000,000 acres) of land under irrigation, various schemes have been attempted, including the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) which was provided ₹800 billion (equivalent to ₹1.2\\xa0trillion or US$14\\xa0billion in 2023) in the Union Budget.[214] Farming incomes are also hampered by lack of food storage and distribution infrastructure; a third of India\\'s agricultural production is lost from spoilage.[215]\\n\\nAutomobile industry\\nMain article: Automotive industry in India\\nMahindra BE6 EV\\nThe automotive industry in India is one of the largest and fastest-growing globally, contributing significantly to the country\\'s economy, employment, and export performance. As of 2023, India ranked as the fourth-largest automobile producer in the world, following China, United States and Japan. The sector accounts for approximately 7.1% of India\\'s GDP and employs over 37 million people directly and indirectly.[216][217] As of April\\xa02022[update], India\\'s auto industry is worth more than US$100 billion and accounts for 8% of the country\\'s total exports and 7.1% of India\\'s GDP.[218]\\nIndia\\'s automotive market comprises both domestic and international manufacturers.

While some of these relate to nationalised banks – such as reforms encouraging mergers, reducing government interference and increasing profitability and competitiveness – other reforms have opened the banking and insurance sectors to private and foreign companies.[279][310]\\n\\nRetail\\nMain article: Retailing in India\\nSurat Diamond City Aerial View\\nThe retail industry, excluding wholesale, contributed $793\\xa0billion (10% of GDP) and employed 35 million people (8% of the workforce) in 2020. The industry is the second largest employer in India, after agriculture.[311][312][313] The Indian retail market is estimated to be US$600\\xa0billion and one of the top-five retail markets in the world by economic value. India has one of the fastest-growing retail markets in the world,[314][315] and is projected to reach $1.3\\xa0trillion by 2020.[316][317] India has retail market worth $1.17\\xa0trillion, which contributes over 10% of India\\'s GDP. It also has one of the world\\'s fastest growing e-commerce markets.[318] The e-commerce retail market in India was valued at $32.7\\xa0billion in 2018, and is expected to reach $71.9\\xa0billion by 2022.[319]\\nIndia\\'s retail industry mostly consists of local mom-and-pop stores, owner-staffed shops and street vendors. Retail supermarkets are expanding, with a market share of 4% in 2008.[320] In 2012, the government permitted 51% FDI in multi-brand retail and 100% FDI in single-brand retail. However, a lack of back-end warehouse infrastructure and state-level permits and red tape continue to limit growth of organised retail.[321] Compliance with over thirty regulations such as \"signboard licences\" and \"anti-hoarding measures\" must be made before a store can open for business. There are taxes for moving goods from state to state, and even within states.[320]\\n\\n Scenic view from Harangi Elephant Camp & Tree Park in Coorg\\nIndustries\\nTourism\\nMain article: Tourism in India\\nAyodhya became the top destination in 2024\\nThe World Travel & Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated ₹15.24 trillion (US$180\\xa0billion) or 9.4% of the nation\\'s GDP in 2017 and supported 41.622 million jobs, 8% of its total employment. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to ₹32.05 trillion (US$380\\xa0billion) by 2028 (9.9% of GDP).[322] Over 10 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2017 compared to 8.89 million in 2016, recording a growth of 15.6%.[323] The tourism industry contributes about 9.2% of India\\'s GDP and employs over 42 million people.[324] India earned $21.07\\xa0billion in foreign exchange from tourism receipts in 2015.[325] International tourism to India has seen a steady growth from 2.37 million arrivals in 1997 to 8.03 million arrivals in 2015. Bangladesh is the largest source of international tourists to India, while European Union nations and Japan are other major sources of international tourists.[326][327] In 2024, Ayodhya, particularly with the Ram Temple became Uttar Pradesh\\'s top tourist destination, attracting more domestic and international visitors.[328] Coorg became the top fastest growing destination and hill station in 2024.[329][330] Less than 10% of international tourists visit the Taj Mahal, with the majority visiting other cultural, thematic and holiday circuits.[331] Over 12 million Indian citizens take international trips each year for tourism, while domestic tourism within India adds about 740 million Indian travellers.[326]\\nIndia has a fast-growing medical tourism sector of its health care economy, offering low-cost health services and long-term care.[332][333] In October 2015, the medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3\\xa0billion. It is projected to grow to $7–8\\xa0billion by 2020.[334] In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek medical treatment.[335]\\n\\nWedding Industry\\nIndia\\'s wedding industry has a size of $75 billion, second largest after China. It is the fourth largest industry in India.[336] The wedding industry saw significant growth in 2023 as weddings became larger and more extravagant post the pandemic blues. Average guest size grew by nearly 15%, from 270 guests in 2022 to 310 in 2023. Celebrations also expanded, with couples now hosting an average of 4.2 functions, up from 3.2.A significant 27 lakh weddings fall in the ₹10-25 lakh range, reflecting the popularity of mid-range wedding budgets. Smaller budgets like ₹3 lakh and ₹6 lakh account for 10 lakh weddings each, while high-end weddings costing ₹1 crore or more make up 50,000 weddings.\\nIndia hosts the highest number of weddings in the world each year, as per investment banking and capital market firm Jefferies. However, in terms of market size, the Indian wedding industry is still smaller than China\\'s but almost twice as big as the US\\'s.[337]\\n\\nFilms, entertainment and music industry\\nMain article: Cinema of India\\nThe Indian cinema industry is expected to garner a revenue of around Rs 16,198 crore by 2026, of which Rs 15,849 would be Box office revenue and the rest Rs 349 crore from advertising, the report added.[338]\\nIndia\\'s Recorded Music industry (which is a key sub-segment) is making steady progress at a CAGR of 13.6 percent, thanks to streaming models.[338]\\n\\nRegional economies\\nFurther information: List of Indian states and union territories by GDP\\nIndia\\'s regional economies vary significantly in terms of output, industrial composition, and development levels. Maharashtra has the largest state economy, contributing over 13% to the national GDP, followed by Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.[339] These five states collectively account for nearly half of India\\'s economic output. Southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Telangana are known for strong performance in services and manufacturing, while western states like Gujarat and Maharashtra are industrial powerhouses. In contrast, eastern and central states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh exhibit lower GDPs, reflecting ongoing challenges in industrialisation and infrastructure. Union Territories like Delhi and Chandigarh, though smaller in size, have high per capita incomes due to urban-centric service-driven economies. This economic landscape highlights both growth opportunities and regional disparities, underscoring the need for tailored economic strategies across states.\\n\\n\\n\\nPercent of share of states in GDP of India in 2024-25\\n\\nMaharashtra (13.2%)\\nTamil Nadu (9.56%)\\nKarnataka (8.68%)\\nGujarat (8.64%)\\nUttar Pradesh (8.22%)\\nWest Bengal (5.79%)\\nRajasthan (5.29%)\\nAndhra Pradesh (4.66%)\\nTelangana (4.71%)\\nMadhya Pradesh (4.67%)\\nKerala (3.80%)\\nOthers (22.8%)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Indian States and UTs for 2024–25 (Nominal)[340]\\n\\n\\nS.No\\nState/UT\\nGSDP (₹ Lakh Crore)\\nGSDP (Billion USD)\\nShare\\xa0%\\nEquivalent Country (Nominal GDP)\\n\\n\\n1\\nMaharashtra\\n42.67\\n497.86\\n13.17%\\n Austria\\n\\n\\n2\\nTamil Nadu\\n30.97\\n361.45\\n9.56%\\n Denmark\\n\\n\\n3\\nKarnataka\\n28.13\\n328.17\\n8.68%\\n Malaysia\\n\\n\\n4\\nGujarat\\n27.99\\n326.54\\n8.64%\\n Singapore\\n\\n\\n5\\nUttar Pradesh\\n26.63\\n310.88\\n8.22%\\n Philippines\\n\\n\\n6\\nWest Bengal\\n18.76\\n219.01\\n5.79%\\n New Zealand\\n\\n\\n7\\nRajasthan\\n17.13\\n199.79\\n5.29%\\n Hungary\\n\\n\\n8\\nAndhra Pradesh\\n15.81\\n184.53\\n4.88%\\n Romania\\n\\n\\n9\\nTelangana\\n15.26\\n178.00\\n4.71%\\n Ukraine\\n\\n\\n10\\nMadhya Pradesh\\n15.12\\n176.37\\n4.67%\\n Ukraine\\n\\n\\n11\\nKerala\\n12.31\\n143.64\\n3.80%\\n Slovakia\\n\\n\\n12\\nHaryana\\n12.19\\n142.24\\n3.76%\\n Ecuador\\n\\n\\n13\\nDelhi\\n11.33\\n132.23\\n3.50%\\n Kenya\\n\\n\\n14\\nBihar\\n9.76\\n113.96\\n3.01%\\n Sri Lanka\\n\\n\\n15\\nOdisha\\n9.42\\n109.94\\n2.91%\\n Croatia\\n\\n\\n16\\nPunjab\\n8.91\\n104.00\\n2.75%\\n Luxembourg\\n\\n\\n17\\nAssam\\n6.46\\n75.39\\n2.00%\\n Bulgaria\\n\\n\\n18\\nChhattisgarh\\n5.80\\n67.68\\n1.59%\\n Serbia\\n\\n\\n19\\nJharkhand\\n4.82\\n56.25\\n1.32%\\n Ethiopia\\n\\n\\n20\\nUttarakhand\\n3.80\\n44.34\\n1.05%\\n Latvia\\n\\n\\n21\\nJammu & Kashmir\\n2.63\\n30.69\\n0.70%\\n \\xa0\\xa0Nepal\\n\\n\\n22\\nHimachal Pradesh\\n2.45\\n28.59\\n0.65%\\n Georgia\\n\\n\\n23\\nGoa\\n1.14\\n13.30\\n0.35%\\n Mali\\n\\n\\n24\\nAndaman & Nicobar Islands\\n1.02\\n11.90\\n0.31%\\n Malawi\\n\\n\\n25\\nChandigarh\\n0.56\\n6.54\\n0.17%\\n Fiji\\n\\n\\n26\\nSikkim\\n0.54\\n6.30\\n0.17%\\n Montenegro\\n\\n\\n27\\nMeghalaya\\n0.54\\n6.30\\n0.17%\\n Montenegro\\n\\n\\n28\\nManipur\\n0.52\\n6.07\\n0.16%\\n Liberia\\n\\n\\n29\\nPuducherry\\n0.45\\n5.25\\n0.14%\\n Lesotho\\n\\n\\n30\\nArunachal Pradesh\\n0.44\\n5.13\\n0.14%\\n Lesotho\\n\\n\\n31\\nNagaland\\n0.43\\n5.02\\n0.13%\\n Belize\\n\\n\\n32\\nMizoram\\n0.42\\n4.90\\n0.13%\\n Belize\\n\\n\\n33\\nTripura\\n0.31\\n3.62\\n0.10%\\n Bhutan\\n\\n\\nTotal India (2024–25)\\n324.11\\n3780.00\\n100%\\nIndia\\n\\nEmployment\\nSee also: Labour in India, Indian labour law, Child labour in India, and Unemployment in India\\nIndia: extreme poverty rates from 1977 to 2022[341]\\nAgricultural and allied sectors accounted for about 52% of the total workforce in 2009–10. While agriculture employment has fallen over time in percentage of labour employed, services which include construction and infrastructure have seen a steady growth accounting for 20.3% of employment in 2012–13.[342] Of the total workforce, 7% is in the organised sector, two-thirds of which are in the government-controlled public sector.[343] About 51.2% of the workforce in India is self-employed.[342] Despite having one of the longest working hours, India has one of the lowest workforce productivity levels in the world.[344][345][346][347][348] According to a 2005–06 survey, there is a gender gap in employment and salaries. In rural areas, both men and women are primarily self-employed, mostly in agriculture. In urban areas, salaried work was the largest source of employment for both men and women in 2006.[349]\\n\\nUnemployment\\nMain article: Unemployment in India\\nUnemployment in India is characterised by chronic (disguised) unemployment. Government schemes that target eradication of both poverty and unemployment – which in recent decades has sent millions of poor and unskilled people into urban areas in search of livelihoods – attempt to solve the problem by providing financial assistance for starting businesses, honing skills, setting up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments, etc. The decline in organised employment, due to the decreased role of the public sector after liberalisation, has further underlined the need for focusing on better education and created political pressure for further reforms.[350][351] India\\'s labour regulations are heavy, even by developing country standards, and analysts have urged the government to abolish or modify them to make the environment more conducive for employment generation.[352][353] The 11th five-year plan has also identified the need for a congenial environment to be created for employment generation, by reducing the number of permissions and other bureaucratic clearances required.[354] Inequalities and inadequacies in the education system have been identified as an obstacle, which prevents the benefits of increased employment opportunities from reaching all sectors of society.[355]\\n\\nChild labour\\nMain article: Child labour in India\\nChild labour is a complex problem that is rooted in poverty. Since the 1990s, the government has implemented a variety of programs to eliminate child labour. These have included setting up schools, launching free school lunch programs, creating special investigation cells, etc.[356][357] Author Sonalde Desai stated that recent studies on child labour in India have found some pockets of industries in which children are employed, but overall, relatively few Indian children are employed. Child labour below the age of 10 is now rare. In the 10–14 age group, the latest surveys find only 2% of children working for wage, while another 9% work within their home or rural farms assisting their parents in times of high work demand such as sowing and harvesting of crops.[358]\\n\\nDiaspora remittance\\nIndia has the largest diaspora around the world, an estimated 32 million people according to the Ministry of External Affairs (India),[359] many of whom work overseas and remit funds back to their families. The Middle East region is the largest source of employment for expat Indians. The crude oil production and infrastructure industry of Saudi Arabia employs over 2 million expat Indians. Cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi in United Arab Emirates have employed another 2 million Indians during the construction boom in recent decades.[360] In 2009–10, remittances from Indian migrants overseas stood at ₹2.5 trillion (equivalent to ₹5.6\\xa0trillion or US$66\\xa0billion in 2023), the highest in the world, but their share in FDI remained low at around 1%.[361]\\n\\nTrade unions\\nMain article: Trade unions in India\\nIn India, the Trade Union movement is generally divided on political lines. According to provisional statistics from the Ministry of Labour, trade unions had a combined membership of 24,601,589 in 2002. As of 2008, there are 12 Central Trade Union Organisations (CTUO) recognized by the Ministry of Labour.[362] The forming of these unions was a big deal in India. It led to a big push for more regulatory laws which gave workers a lot more power.[363]\\nAITUC is the oldest trade union in India. It is a left supported organization.\\nA trade union with nearly 2,000,000 members is the Self Employed Women\\'s Association (SEWA) which protects the rights of Indian women working in the informal economy. In addition to the protection of rights, SEWA educates, mobilizes, finances, and exalts their members\\' trades.[364] Multiple other organizations represent workers. These organizations are formed upon different political groups. These different groups allow different groups of people with different political views to join a Union.[365]\\n\\nIncome and consumption\\nMain article: Income in India\\nThis article needs to be updated.

It tripled from ₹19,040 in 2002–03 to ₹53,331 in 2010–11, averaging 13.7% growth each of these eight years, with peak growth of 15.6% in 2010–11[368] and, growth in the inflation-adjusted per-capita income of the nation slowed to 5.6% in 2010–11, down from 6.4% in the previous year. These consumption levels are on an individual basis.[369] The average family income in India was $6,671 per household in 2011.[370]\\nAccording to 2011 census data, India has about 330 million houses and 247 million households. The household size in India has dropped in recent years, the 2011 census reporting 50% of households have four or fewer members, with an average of 4.8 members per household including surviving grandparents.[371][372] These households produced a GDP of about $1.7\\xa0trillion.[373] Consumption patterns note: approximately 67% of households use firewood, crop residue, or cow-dung cakes for cooking purposes; 53% do not have sanitation or drainage facilities on premises; 83% have water supply within their premises or 100 metres (330\\xa0ft) from their house in urban areas and 500 metres (1,600\\xa0ft) from the house in rural areas; 67% of the households have access to electricity; 63% of households have landline or mobile telephone service; 43% have a television; 26% have either a two- or four-wheel motor vehicle. Compared to 2001, these income and consumption trends represent moderate to significant improvements.[371] One report in 2010 claimed that high-income households outnumber low-income households.[374]\\n\\nCountries by nominal GNI per capita according to the Atlas method (2018)\\nNew World Wealth publishes reports tracking the total wealth of countries, which is measured as the private wealth held by all residents of a country.

India\\'s total wealth decreased by 1% from $8.23\\xa0trillion in 2017 to $8.148\\xa0trillion in 2018, making it the sixth wealthiest nation in the world. There are 20,730 multimillionaires (7th largest in the world)[375] and 118 billionaires in India (3rd largest in the world). With 327,100 high net-worth individuals (HNWI), India is home to the 9th highest number of HNWIs in the world. Mumbai is the wealthiest Indian city and the 12th wealthiest in the world, with a total net worth of $941\\xa0billion in 2018. Twenty-eight billionaires reside in the city, ranked ninth worldwide.[376] As of December\\xa02016,[update] the next wealthiest cities in India were Delhi ($450\\xa0billion), Bengaluru ($320\\xa0billion), Hyderabad ($310\\xa0billion), Kolkata ($290\\xa0billion), Chennai ($200\\xa0billion), and Gurugram ($110\\xa0billion).[377][378]\\nThe Global Wealth Migration Review 2019 report, published by New World Wealth, found that 5,000 HNWI\\'s emigrated from India in 2018, or about 2% of all HNWIs in the country. Australia, Canada, and United States were among the top destination countries.[379] The report also projected that private wealth in India would grow by around 180% to reach $22,814\\xa0billion by 2028.[376]\\n\\nPoverty\\nMain article: Poverty in India\\nPoverty rate map of India by prevalence in 2012, among its states and union territories\\nIn May 2014, the World Bank reviewed and proposed revisions to its poverty calculation methodology of 2005 and purchasing-power-parity basis for measuring poverty. According to the revised methodology, the world had 872.3 million people below the new poverty line, of which 179.6 million lived in India. With 17.5% of the total world\\'s population, India had a 20.6% share of the world\\'s poorest in 2013.[380] According to a 2005–2006 survey,[381] India had about 61 million children under the age of 5 who were chronically malnourished. A 2011 UNICEF report stated that between 1990 and 2010, India achieved a 45 percent reduction in mortality rates under the age of 5, and now ranks 46th of 188 countries on this metric.[382]\\nSince the early 1960s, successive governments have implemented various schemes to alleviate poverty, under central planning, that have met with partial success.[383] In 2005, the government enacted the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), guaranteeing 100\\xa0days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in all the districts of India.[384] In 2011, it was widely criticised and beset with controversy for corrupt officials, deficit financing as the source of funds, poor quality of infrastructure built under the programme, and unintended destructive effects.[385][386][387] Other studies suggest that the programme has helped reduce rural poverty in some cases.[388][389] Yet other studies report that India\\'s economic growth has been the driver of sustainable employment and poverty reduction, though a sizeable population remains in poverty.[390][391] India lifted 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016, recording the fastest reductions in the multidimensional poverty index values during the period with strong improvements in areas such as assets, cooking fuel, sanitation, and nutrition.[392]\\nOn the 2019 Global Hunger Index India ranked 102nd (out of 117 countries) with a score of 30.3, being categorized as \\'serious\\' in severity.[393] In 2024, India ranked 105 (out of 127 countries) with a score of 27.3, indicating an improvement in its hunger situation.[394][395]\\nAccording to the World Bank’s Spring 2025 Poverty and Equity Brief, approximately 171 million people in India moved out of extreme poverty between 2011 and 2023. During this period, the country\\'s poverty rate declined significantly from 16.2% to 2.3%, based on the international poverty line of $2.15 per day.[396]\\n\\nCurrency\\nMain articles: Indian rupee and Reserve Bank of India\\nThe Reserve Bank of India\\'s headquarters in Mumbai, India\\n\\xa0• EXCHANGE RATES\\n\\n\\n\\nYear\\nINR₹ per US$(annual average)[397]\\nINR₹ per Pound(£)(annual average)[398]\\n\\n\\n1947\\n3.31\\n13.33\\n\\n\\n1950\\n4.76\\n—\\n\\n\\n1967\\n7.50\\n17.76\\n\\n\\n1975\\n9.4058\\n—\\n\\n\\n1980\\n7.88\\n—\\n\\n\\n1985\\n12.364\\n—\\n\\n\\n1987\\n—\\n21.18\\n\\n\\n1990\\n17.4992\\n31.07\\n\\n\\n1995\\n32.4198\\n51.17\\n\\n\\n2000\\n44.9401\\n67.99\\n\\n\\n2005\\n44.1000\\n80.15\\n\\n\\n2010\\n45.7393\\n70.65\\n\\n\\n2015\\n64.05\\n98.0101\\n\\n\\n2016\\n67.09\\n90.72\\n\\n\\n2017\\n64.14\\n87.56\\n\\n\\n2018\\n\\n69.71\\n98.51\\n\\n\\n2019\\n\\n70.394\\n95.06\\n\\n\\n2020\\n\\n72.97\\n100.05\\n\\n\\n2021\\n\\n74.98\\n101.56\\n\\n\\n2022\\n\\n81.35\\n96.23\\n\\n\\n2023\\n\\n81.94\\n100.95\\n\\n\\nThe Indian rupee (₹) is the only legal tender in India, and is also accepted as legal tender in neighbouring Nepal and Bhutan, both of which peg their currency to that of the Indian rupee. The rupee previously was divided into 100 paise, which no longer exist. The highest-denomination banknote was the ₹2,000 note until 30 September 2023 after which it was scrapped and ₹500 note became the highest denomination; the lowest-denomination coin in circulation is the ₹1 coin.[400] In 2017, demonetisation was announced in which ₹500 and ₹1000 notes were withdrawn and new ₹500 notes were issued. India\\'s monetary system is managed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country\\'s central bank.[401] Established on 1 April 1935 and nationalised in 1949, the RBI serves as the nation\\'s monetary authority, regulator and supervisor of the monetary system, banker to the government, custodian of foreign exchange reserves, and as an issuer of currency. It is governed by a central board of directors, headed by a governor who is appointed by the Government of India.[402] The benchmark interest rates are set by the Monetary Policy Committee.\\nThe rupee was linked to the British pound from 1927 to 1946, and then to US dollar until 1975 through a fixed exchange rate. It was devalued in September 1975 and the system of fixed par rate was replaced with a basket of four major international currencies: the British pound, US dollar, the Japanese yen and the Deutsche Mark.[403] In 1991, after the collapse of its largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, India faced the major foreign exchange crisis and the rupee was devalued by around 19% in two stages on 1 and 2 July. In 1992, a Liberalized Exchange Rate Mechanism (LERMS) was introduced. Under LERMS, exporters had to surrender 40 percent of their foreign exchange earnings to the RBI at the RBI-determined exchange rate; the remaining 60% could be converted at the market-determined exchange rate. In 1994, the rupee was convertible on the current account, with some capital controls.[404]\\nAfter the sharp devaluation in 1991 and transition to current account convertibility in 1994, the value of the rupee has been largely determined by market forces. The rupee has been fairly stable during the decade 2000–2010. In October 2022, rupee touched an all-time low 83.29 to US dollar.[405][406]\\n\\nSecurity markets\\nThe National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) is the biggest stock exchange in India by trading volume as 96% trading occurs in NSE\\nThe development of Indian security markets began with the launch of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in July 1875 and the Ahmedabad Stock Exchange in 1894. Since then, 22 other exchanges have traded in Indian cities. In 2014, India\\'s stock exchange market became the 10th largest in the world by market capitalisation, just above those of South Korea and Australia.[407] India\\'s two major stock exchanges, BSE and the National Stock Exchange of India, had a market capitalisation of US$1.71\\xa0trillion and US$1.68\\xa0trillion as of February\\xa02015,[update] according to the World Federation of Exchanges, which grew to $3.36 trillion and $3.31 trillion respectively by September 2021.[408][409]\\nThe initial public offering (IPO) market in India has been small compared to NYSE and NASDAQ, raising US$300\\xa0million in 2013 and US$1.4\\xa0billion in 2012. Ernst & Young stated[410] that the low IPO activity reflects market conditions, slow government approval processes, and complex regulations. Before 2013, Indian companies were not allowed to list their securities internationally without first completing an IPO in India. In 2013, these security laws were reformed and Indian companies can now choose where they want to list first: overseas, domestically, or both concurrently.[411] Further, security laws have been revised to ease overseas listings of already-listed companies, to increase liquidity for private equity and international investors in Indian companies.[410]\\n\\nForeign trade and investment\\nFurther information: Globalisation in India\\nA map showing the global distribution of Indian exports in 2006 as a percentage of the top market (US at $20.9\\xa0billion)\\nMajor Trade Partners\\nThe following table shows the largest trading partners for India in 2024-25 by total trade value in billions of USD.[412]\\n\\n\\n\\nCountry\\n\\nExport Value\\n\\nImport Value\\n\\nTotal Trade Value\\n\\nBalance\\n\\n\\n\\xa0United States\\n\\n88.02\\n\\n43.01\\n\\n130.3\\n\\n45.01\\n\\n\\n\\xa0China\\n\\n16.66\\n\\n101.75\\n\\n118.41\\n\\n-85.09\\n\\n\\n\\xa0United Arab Emirates\\n\\n35.63\\n\\n48.02\\n\\n83.65\\n\\n-12.39\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Russia\\n\\n4.26\\n\\n61.43\\n\\n65.69\\n\\n-57.17\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Saudi Arabia\\n\\n11.56\\n\\n31.81\\n\\n43.37\\n\\n-20.25\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Singapore\\n\\n14.41\\n\\n21.20\\n\\n35.61\\n\\n-6.79\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Iraq\\n\\n3.35\\n\\n30.00\\n\\n33.35\\n\\n-26.65\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Indonesia\\n\\n5.99\\n\\n23.41\\n\\n29.40\\n\\n-17.42\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Hong Kong\\n\\n8.24\\n\\n20.45\\n\\n28.69\\n\\n-12.21\\n\\n\\n\\xa0South Korea\\n\\n6.42\\n\\n21.14\\n\\n27.56\\n\\n-14.72\\n\\n\\nForeign trade\\nMain article: Foreign trade of India\\nFurther information: List of the largest trading partners of India\\nIndia\\'s main trading partners in FY 2024-25[413]\\nIndia\\'s exports (top) and imports (bottom), by value, in 2013–14\\nIndia\\'s foreign trade by year\\n\\n\\nYear\\n\\nTotal Trade(in USD billion)\\n\\nExports(in USD billion)\\n\\nImports(in USD billion)\\n\\nTrade Deficit (in USD billion)\\n\\n\\n2024\\n\\n1,631.48\\n\\n776.68\\n\\n854.80\\n\\n-78.12\\n\\n\\n2023\\n\\n1,662.36\\n\\n770.18\\n\\n892.18\\n\\n-122.00\\n\\n\\n2022[414]\\n\\n1,436.59\\n\\n676.53\\n\\n760.06\\n\\n-83.53\\n\\n\\n2021\\n\\n1,032\\n\\n420\\n\\n612\\n\\n-192.00\\n\\n\\n2020\\n\\n781.5\\n\\n314.31\\n\\n467.19\\n\\n-158.88\\n\\n\\n2019\\n\\n844.14\\n\\n330.07\\n\\n514.07\\n\\n-184\\n\\n\\n2018\\n\\n769.1\\n\\n303.52\\n\\n465.58\\n\\n-162.05\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n660.1\\n\\n275.8\\n\\n384.3\\n\\n-108.5\\n\\n\\n2016\\n\\n643.3\\n\\n262.3\\n\\n381\\n\\n-118.7\\n\\n\\n2015\\n\\n758.2\\n\\n310.3\\n\\n447.9\\n\\n-137.6\\n\\n\\n2014\\n\\n781.1\\n\\n318.2\\n\\n462.9\\n\\n-144.7\\n\\n\\n2013\\n\\n780.7\\n\\n313.2\\n\\n467.5\\n\\n-154.3\\n\\n\\n2012\\n\\n798.8\\n\\n298.4\\n\\n500.4\\n\\n-202.0\\n\\n\\n2011\\n\\n760.8\\n\\n299.4\\n\\n461.4\\n\\n-162.0\\n\\n\\n2010\\n\\n528.1\\n\\n201.1\\n\\n327.0\\n\\n-125.9\\n\\n\\n2009\\n\\n442.5\\n\\n168.2\\n\\n274.3\\n\\n-106.1\\n\\n\\n2008\\n\\n481.9\\n\\n176.4\\n\\n305.5\\n\\n-129.1\\n\\n\\n2007\\n\\n212.9\\n\\n112.0\\n\\n100.9\\n\\n11.1\\n\\n\\n2006\\n\\n189.33\\n\\n76.23\\n\\n113.1\\n\\n-36.87\\n\\n\\n2005\\n\\n158.51\\n\\n69.18\\n\\n89.33\\n\\n-20.15\\n\\n\\n2004\\n\\n131.39\\n\\n57.24\\n\\n74.15\\n\\n-16.91\\n\\n\\n2003\\n\\n109.9\\n\\n48.3\\n\\n61.6\\n\\n-13.3\\n\\n\\n2002\\n\\n98.3\\n\\n44.5\\n\\n53.8\\n\\n-9.3\\n\\n\\n2001\\n\\n97\\n\\n42.5\\n\\n54.5\\n\\n-12.0\\n\\n\\n2000\\n\\n103.9\\n\\n43.1\\n\\n60.8\\n\\n-17.7\\n\\n\\n1999\\n\\n86.5\\n\\n36.3\\n\\n50.2\\n\\n-13.9\\n\\nUntil the liberalisation of 1991, India was largely and intentionally isolated from world markets, to protect its economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative restrictions, while foreign direct investment (FDI) was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200\\xa0million annually between 1985 and 1991; a large percentage of the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing and deposits of non-resident Indians.[415] India\\'s exports were stagnant for the first 15\\xa0years after independence, due to general neglect of trade policy by the government of that period; imports in the same period, with early industrialisation, consisted predominantly of machinery, raw materials and consumer goods.[416]\\nSince liberalisation, the value of India\\'s international trade has increased sharply,[417] with the contribution of total trade in goods and services to the GDP rising from 16% in 1990–91 to 47% in 2009–10.[418][419] Foreign trade accounted for 48.8% of India\\'s GDP in 2015.[420] Globally, India accounts for 1.44% of exports and 2.12% of imports for merchandise trade and 3.34% of exports and 3.31% of imports for commercial services trade.[419] India\\'s major trading partners are the European Union, China, United States and United Arab Emirates.[421] In 2006–07, major export commodities included engineering goods, petroleum products, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, textiles and garments, agricultural products, iron ore and other minerals. Major import commodities included crude oil and related products, machinery, electronic goods, gold and silver.[422] In November 2010, exports increased 22.3% year-on-year to ₹851 billion (equivalent to ₹1.9\\xa0trillion or US$23\\xa0billion in 2023), while imports were up 7.5% at ₹1.25 trillion (equivalent to ₹2.8\\xa0trillion or US$33\\xa0billion in 2023). The trade deficit for the same month dropped from ₹469 billion (equivalent to ₹1.2\\xa0trillion or US$14\\xa0billion in 2023) in 2009 to ₹401 billion (equivalent to ₹900\\xa0billion or US$11\\xa0billion in 2023) in 2010.[423]\\nIndia is a founding-member of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the WTO. While participating actively in its general council meetings, India has been crucial in voicing the concerns of the developing world. For instance, India has continued its opposition to the inclusion of labour, environmental issues and other non-tariff barriers to trade in WTO policies.[424]\\nIndia secured 43rd place in competitiveness index.[425]\\n\\nBalance of payments\\nCumulative current account balance 1980–2008 based on IMF data\\nSince independence, India\\'s balance of payments on its current account has been negative. Since economic liberalisation in the 1990s, precipitated by a balance-of-payment crisis, India\\'s exports rose consistently, covering 80.3% of its imports in 2002–03, up from 66.2% in 1990–91.[426] However, the global economic slump followed by a general deceleration in world trade saw the exports as a percentage of imports drop to 61.4% in 2008–09.[427] India\\'s growing oil import bill is seen as the main driver behind the large current account deficit,[428] which rose to $118.7\\xa0billion, or 11.11% of GDP, in 2008–09.[429] Between January and October 2010, India imported $82.1\\xa0billion worth of crude oil.[428] The Indian economy has run a trade deficit every year from 2002 to 2012, with a merchandise trade deficit of US$189\\xa0billion in 2011–12.[430] Its trade with China has the largest deficit, about $31\\xa0billion in 2013.[431]\\nIndia\\'s reliance on external assistance and concessional debt has decreased since liberalisation of the economy, and the debt service ratio decreased from 35.3% in 1990–91 to 4.4% in 2008–09.[432] In India, external commercial borrowings (ECBs), or commercial loans from non-resident lenders, are being permitted by the government for providing an additional source of funds to Indian corporates. The Ministry of Finance monitors and regulates them through ECB policy guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999.[433] India\\'s foreign exchange reserves have steadily risen from $5.8\\xa0billion in March 1991 to ₹38,832.21\\xa0billion (US$540\\xa0billion) in July 2020.[434][435] In 2012, United Kingdom announced an end to all financial aid to India, citing the growth and robustness of Indian economy.[436][437]\\nIndia\\'s current account deficit reached an all-time high in 2013.[438] India has historically funded its current account deficit through borrowings by companies in the overseas markets or remittances by non-resident Indians and portfolio inflows. From April 2016 to January 2017, RBI data showed that, for the first time since 1991, India was funding its deficit through foreign direct investment inflows. The Economic Times noted that the development was \"a sign of rising confidence among long-term investors in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s ability to strengthen the country\\'s economic foundation for sustained growth\".[439]\\n\\nForeign direct investment\\nThis section needs to be updated.

India has strengths in telecommunication, information technology and other significant areas such as auto components, chemicals, apparels, pharmaceuticals, and jewellery. Despite a surge in foreign investments, rigid FDI policies[442] were a significant hindrance. Over time, India has adopted a number of FDI reforms.[441] India has a large pool of skilled managerial and technical expertise. The size of the middle-class population stands at 300 million and represents a growing consumer market.[443]\\nIndia liberalised its FDI policy in 2005, allowing up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated easy access to foreign technology and investment. The upward growth curve of the real-estate sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalised FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100% FDI in the construction sector, including built-up infrastructure and construction development projects comprising housing, commercial premises, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure.[444] Between 2012 and 2014, India extended these reforms to defence, telecom, oil, retail, aviation, and other sectors.[445][446]\\nFrom 2000 to 2010, the country attracted $178\\xa0billion as FDI.[447] The inordinately high investment from Mauritius is due to routing of international funds through the country given significant tax advantages – double taxation is avoided due to a tax treaty between India and Mauritius, and Mauritius is a capital gains tax haven, effectively creating a zero-taxation FDI channel.[448] FDI accounted for 2.1% of India\\'s GDP in 2015.[420]\\nAs the government has eased 87 foreign investment direct rules across 21 sectors in the last three years, FDI inflows hit $60.1\\xa0billion between 2016 and 2017 in India.[449][450]\\n\\nOutflows\\nSince 2000, Indian companies have expanded overseas, investing FDI and creating jobs outside India. From 2006 to 2010, FDI by Indian companies outside India amounted to 1.34 per cent of its GDP.[451] Indian companies have deployed FDI and started operations in United States,[452] Europe and Africa.[453] The Indian conglomerate Tata Group is United Kingdom\\'s largest manufacturer and private-sector employer.[454][455]\\n\\nRemittances\\nMain article: Remittances to India\\nIn 2015, a total of US$68.91\\xa0billion was made in remittances to India from other countries, and a total of US$8.476\\xa0billion was made in remittances by foreign workers in India to their home countries. UAE, US, and Saudi Arabia were the top sources of remittances to India, while Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal were the top recipients of remittances from India.[456] Remittances to India accounted for 3.32% of the country\\'s GDP in 2015.[420]\\n\\nMergers and acquisitions\\nBetween 1985 and 2018 20,846 deals have been announced in, into (inbound) and out of (outbound) India. This cumulates to a value of US$618\\xa0billion. In terms of value, 2010 has been the most active year with deals worth almost 60 bil. USD.

This would amount to 13 times the country\\'s total external debt.[471][472] These allegations have been denied by the Swiss Banking Association. James Nason, the Head of International Communications for the Swiss Banking Association, suggested \"The (black money) figures were rapidly picked up in the Indian media and in Indian opposition circles, and circulated as gospel truth. However, this story was a complete fabrication. The Swiss Bankers Association never published such a report. Anyone claiming to have such figures (for India) should be forced to identify their source and explain the methodology used to produce them.\"[473][474]\\nA Step was taken by Prime Minister Modi, on 8 November 2016, involved the demonetization of all 500 and 1000 rupee bank notes (replaced by new 500 and 2000 rupee notes) to return black money into the economy followed by criticism that the measure was deemed ineffective by economists and negatively affected the poorest people of India. This demonetisation together with the introduction of The goods and services tax(GST) is believed to be responsible for the slowdown in growth.[475]\\n\\nEducation\\nMain articles: Education in India and Literacy in India\\nUniversity of Calcutta, established in 1857, was the first multidisciplinary and secular Western-style institution in Asia.\\nIndia has made progress in increasing the primary education attendance rate and expanding literacy to approximately three-fourths of the population.[476] India\\'s literacy rate had grown from 52.2% in 1991 to 74.04% in 2011. The right to education at the elementary level has been made one of the fundamental rights under the Eighty-Sixth Amendment of 2002, and legislation has been enacted to further the objective of providing free education to all children.[477] However, the literacy rate of 74% is lower than the worldwide average, and the country suffers from a high drop-out rate.[478] Literacy rates and educational opportunities vary by region, gender, urban and rural areas, and among different social groups.[479][480]\\n\\nEconomic disparities\\nMain articles: Economic disparities in India and Poverty in India\\nEconomic disparities among the states and union territories of India, on GDP per capita, PPP basis, and GDP per capita basis in 2011\\n Poverty rates in India\\'s poorest states are three to four times higher than those in the more advanced states. While India\\'s average annual per capita income was $1,410 in 2011\\xa0– placing it among the poorest of the world\\'s middle-income countries\\xa0– it was just $436 in Uttar Pradesh (which has more people than Brazil) and only $294 in Bihar, one of India\\'s poorest states.\\n—\\u200aWorld Bank: India Country Overview 2013[481]\\nA critical problem facing India\\'s economy is the sharp and growing regional variations among India\\'s different states and territories in terms of poverty, availability of infrastructure, and socio-economic development.[482] Six low-income states\\xa0– Assam, Chhattisgarh, Nagaland, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh\\xa0– are home to more than one-third of India\\'s population.[483] Severe disparities exist among states in terms of income, literacy rates, life expectancy, and living conditions.[484] The four states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka alone are projected to account for almost 50% of India\\'s GDP by 2030; the five South Indian states are projected to contribute 35% of India\\'s GDP by 2030 despite currently having 20% of India\\'s population.[485]\\nThe five-year plans, especially in the pre-liberalisation era, attempted to reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions and distributing industries across states. The results have been discouraging as these measures increased inefficiency and hampered effective industrial growth.[486] The more advanced states have been better placed to benefit from liberalisation, with well-developed infrastructure and an educated and skilled workforce, which attract the manufacturing and service sectors. Governments of less-advanced states have tried to reduce disparities by offering tax holidays and cheap land and focused on sectors like tourism, which can develop faster than other sectors.[487][488] India\\'s income Gini coefficient is 33.9, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), indicating overall income distribution to be more uniform than East Asia, Latin America, and Africa.[14] The Global Wealth Migration Review 2019 report, published by New World Wealth, estimated that 48% of India\\'s total wealth was held by high-net-worth individuals.[376] According to a 2021 report by the Pew Research Center, India has roughly 1.2 billion lower-income individuals, 66 million middle-income individuals, 16 million upper-middle-income individuals, and 2 million in the high-income group.[489] As per The Economist, 78 million of India\\'s population are considered middle class as of 2017, if defined using the cutoff of those making more than $10 per day, a standard used by the India\\'s National Council of Applied Economic Research.[490]\\nThere is a continuing debate on whether India\\'s economic expansion has been pro-poor or anti-poor.[491] Studies suggest that urban economic growth has become less pro-poor since the 1991 economic reforms.[491][492]\\n\\nClimate change\\nSeveral banks including State Bank of India, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have taken the lead in funding green projects even as the Reserve Bank of India comes up with norms for lenders to disclose their actions on climate risk. RBI in an earlier report in 2022, had said that climate change would require \"intensive capital mobilisation\" for that India needs $17.77 trillion.[493]\\nThe RBI recommends that regulated entities rely upon the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, the most prominent climate disclosure framework globally, at least at the initial stage.[494]\\nIndia is home to 75 per cent of the world\\'s wild tiger population. The big cats like lion, tiger, leopard, cheetah, snow leopard, jaguar and puma were on the brink of extinction. With hunting and encroachment, their numbers dropped to a mere 20. Efforts to save the lion started before Independence but it was in 1965 that the Indian Forest Service stepped in to set up a conservation programme. Researchers believe a combination of factors is driving the unprecedented migration in tigers. Rising temperatures due to climate change are making the lower foothills less hospitable.[495]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nIndia portalBusiness and economics portal\\nEconomic Advisory Council\\nEconomic development in India\\nList of Indian states and union territories by GDP\\nList of Indian states and union territories by GDP per capita\\nList of industrial cities in India\\nList of megaprojects in India\\nMake in India, a government programme to encourage manufacturing in India\\nedieval India\\nPolitical funding in India\\nEconomically Weaker Section\\nEvents:\\n\\nGreat Recession\\nEconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\\nWorld oil market chronology from 2003\\nDemonetization\\nEconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in India\\nLists:\\n\\nList of companies of India\\nList of largest companies in India\\nList of the largest trading partners of India\\nList of megaprojects in India\\nTrade unions in India\\nNatural resources of India\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n^ a b Excluded territories\\n\\n^ Indian reports are released on a weekly basis rather than the traditional monthly basis with the figures being of the previous week, by Reserve Bank of India.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ \"Information About Maharashtra, Industries, Economy, Exports of Maharashtra\".

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1]\\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3]\\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[4] Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta,[5] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[12] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI\\'s ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI\\'s long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n\\nGoals\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]\\n\\nReasoning and problem-solving\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[14]\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\nKnowledge representation\\nAn ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[21] and other areas.[22]\\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[23] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[24] situations, events, states, and time;[25] causes and effects;[26] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c]\\n\\nPlanning and decision-making\\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[34]\\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[35] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[36]\\nIn some problems, the agent\\'s preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[38] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[39]\\nGame theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[40]\\n\\nLearning\\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]\\n\\nIn supervised learning, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data.\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[45]\\nIn reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".[46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[48]\\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[49]\\n\\n\\nNatural language processing\\nNatural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages.[50] Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[51]\\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky\\'s generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f] unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[29]). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),[52] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),[53] and others.[54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,[55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.[57]\\n\\nPerception\\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[58]\\nThe field includes speech recognition,[59] image classification,[60] facial recognition, object recognition,[61] object tracking,[62] and robotic perception.[63]\\n\\nSocial intelligence\\nKismet, a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions.[64]\\nAffective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood.[65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.[66] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.[67]\\n\\nGeneral intelligence\\nA machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[68]\\n\\nTechniques\\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b]\\n\\nSearch and optimization\\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[69] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\\n\\nState space search\\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[70] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[71]\\nSimple exhaustive searches[72] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[15] \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[73]\\nAdversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.[74]\\n\\nLocal search\\nIllustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.[75]\\nGradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks,[76] through the backpropagation algorithm.\\nAnother type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.[77]\\nDistributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[78]\\n\\nLogic\\nFormal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[79]\\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")[80] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").[81]\\nDeductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).[82] Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.\\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.[83] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[84]\\nInference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.[85]\\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.[86]\\nNon-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning.[28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.\\n\\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\\nA simple Bayesian network, with the associated conditional probability tables\\nMany problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[87] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[88] and information value theory.[89] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[90] dynamic decision networks,[91] game theory and mechanism design.[92]\\nBayesian networks[93] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][95] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm),[h][97] planning (using decision networks)[98] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[91]\\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[91]\\n\\nExpectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.\\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[99] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[45]\\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use.[100] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[101] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[102]\\nThe naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"[103] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[104]\\nNeural networks are also used as classifiers.[105]\\n\\nArtificial neural networks\\nA neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.\\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[105]\\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[106] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[107]\\nIn feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[108] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network.[109] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers.[110] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem.[111] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing, where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects.[112]\\n\\nDeep learning\\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence.[113]\\nDeep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network\\'s inputs and outputs.[110] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.[114]\\nDeep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification,[115] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.[116] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[i] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[j]\\n\\nGPT\\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems.[124] Such systems are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.[125][126]\\nCurrent models and services include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Meta AI.[127] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.[128]\\n\\nHardware and software\\nMain articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence\\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models\\' training.[129] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research,[130] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.[131]\\nThe transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as Moore\\'s law, named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster,[132] a trend sometimes called Huang\\'s law,[133] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang.\\n\\nApplications\\nMain article: Applications of artificial intelligenceAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple\\'s FaceID or Microsoft\\'s DeepFace and Google\\'s FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple\\'s Photos and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a chief automation officer (CAO).\\nHealth and medicine\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare\\nThe application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life.[134] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.[135][136]\\nFor medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication.[137] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.[137][138] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[139] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.[140] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson\\'s disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson\\'s disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.[141][142]\\n\\nGames\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in video games\\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI\\'s most advanced techniques.[143] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[144] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[145] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world.[146] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus.[147] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games.[148] In 2019, DeepMind\\'s AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.[149] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world\\'s best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.[150] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.[151]\\n\\nMathematics\\nLarge language models, such as GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama or Mistral, are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning[152] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.[153] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.[154] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result.[155] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math, that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems.[156] In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems.[157]\\nAlternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry, AlphaProof and AlphaEvolve[158] all from Google DeepMind,[159] Llemma from EleutherAI[160] or Julius.[161]\\nWhen natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks. The experimental model Gemini Deep Think accepts natural language prompts directly and achieved gold medal results in the International Math Olympiad of 2025.[162]\\nSome models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.[163]\\nTopological deep learning integrates various topological approaches.\\n\\nFinance\\nFinance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years.[164]\\nAccording to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions & Investments Forum, it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I\\'m not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation.\"[165]\\n\\nMilitary\\nMain article: Military applications of artificial intelligence\\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications.[166] The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability.[167] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.[166] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human-operated and autonomous.[167]\\nAI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine.[166][168][169][170]\\n\\nGenerative AI\\nVincent van Gogh in watercolour created by generative AI softwareThese paragraphs are an excerpt from Generative artificial intelligence.[edit]\\nGenerative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI,[171] or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data.[172][173][174] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data[175][176] based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.[177][178]\\nGenerative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video models such as Veo and Sora.[179][180][181][182][183] Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, Meta AI, Microsoft, Google, DeepSeek, and Baidu.[177][184][185]\\n\\nGenerative AI has raised many ethical questions and governance challenges as it can be used for cybercrime, or to deceive or manipulate people through fake news or deepfakes.[186][187] Even if used ethically, it may lead to mass replacement of human jobs.[188] The tools themselves have been criticized as violating intellectual property laws, since they are trained on copyrighted works.[189] Generative AI is used across many industries, including software development,[190] healthcare,[191] finance,[192] entertainment,[193] customer service,[194] sales and marketing,[195] art, writing,[196] fashion,[197] and product design.[198]\\nAgents\\nMain article: Agentic AI\\nAI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.[199][200][201]\\n\\nSexuality\\nApplications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions,[202] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics),[203] AI-generated sexual education content,[204] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika).[205]  AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.[206]\\nAI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors.[207][208]\\n\\nOther industry-specific tasks\\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes.[209] A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.\\nAI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions.[210][211][212]\\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.\\nArtificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.\\nDuring the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.[213]\\n\\nEthics\\nMain article: Ethics of artificial intelligence\\nStreet art in Tel Aviv[214][215]\\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks.[216] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\".[217] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.[218][219] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.[220]\\n\\nRisks and harm\\nPrivacy and copyright\\nFurther information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright\\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\\nAI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI\\'s ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.\\nSensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio.[221] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them.[222] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.[223]\\nAI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy.[224] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of \\'what they know\\' to the question of \\'what they\\'re doing with it\\'.\"[225]\\nGenerative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\".[226][227] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \"robots.txt\" file.[228] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.[229][230] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.[231]\\n\\nDominance by tech giants\\nThe commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.[232][233][234] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.[235][236]\\n\\nPower needs and environmental impacts\\nSee also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence\\nIn January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use.[237] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.[238]\\nProdigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.[239]\\nA 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[240] Data centers\\' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[241]\\nIn 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million.[242] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.[243]\\nIn September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act.[244] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon\\'s spinoff of Constellation.[245]\\nAfter the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.[246] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025.[246] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.[246]\\nAlthough most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.[247] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.[247]\\nOn 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon\\'s data center.[248] \\nAccording to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.[248]\\nIn 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.[249]\\n\\nMisinformation\\nSee also: YouTube §\\xa0Moderation and offensive content\\nYouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.[250] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[251] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.[252]\\nIn the early 2020s, generative AI began to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing,[253] while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s.[254][255][256] It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda;[257] one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda.[258] AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.[259]\\nAI researchers at Microsoft, OpenAI, universities and other organisations have suggested using \"personhood credentials\" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models.[260]\\n\\nAlgorithmic bias and fairness\\nMain articles: Algorithmic bias and Fairness (machine learning)\\nMachine learning applications will be biased[k] if they learn from biased data.[262] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[263] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[264][262] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.[265] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\\nOn June 28, 2015, Google Photos\\'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[266] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[267] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[268]\\nCOMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[269] In 2017, several researchers[l] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[271]\\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[272] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn\\'t work.\"[273]\\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.[274] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.[m]\\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[267]\\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.[261]\\nAt its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[dubious – discuss][276]\\n\\nLack of transparency\\nSee also: Explainable AI, Algorithmic transparency, and Right to explanation\\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[277] Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are many non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[278]\\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[279] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[280]\\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation.[281] Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[n] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[282]\\nDARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.[283]\\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.[284] LIME can locally approximate a model\\'s outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.[285] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[286] Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[287] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.[288]\\n\\nBad actors and weaponized AI\\nMain articles: Lethal autonomous weapon, Artificial intelligence arms race, and AI safety\\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[290] Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person.[290] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations\\' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.[291] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[292]\\nAI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision-making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware.[293] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.[294][295]\\nThere are many other ways in which AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[296]\\n\\nTechnological unemployment\\nMain articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment\\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[297]\\nIn the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we\\'re in uncharted territory\" with AI.[298] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[299] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[p][301] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[297] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[302][303]\\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[304] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[305]\\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.[306]\\n\\nExistential risk\\nMain article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence\\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\".[307] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character.[q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\\nFirst, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip maximizer).[309] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead.\"[310] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[311]\\nSecond, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are built on language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[312]\\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[313] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk,[314] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.\\nIn May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\".[315] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover,[316] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[317]\\nIn 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".[318]\\nSome other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"[319] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\"[320][321] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it\\'s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\"[322] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers\\' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"[323] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[324] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.[325]\\n\\nEthical machines and alignment\\nMain articles: Machine ethics, AI safety, Friendly artificial intelligence, Artificial moral agents, and Human Compatible\\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[326]\\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[327]\\nThe field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[327]\\nand was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[328]\\nOther approaches include Wendell Wallach\\'s \"artificial moral agents\"[329] and Stuart J. Russell\\'s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[330]\\n\\nOpen source\\nSee also: Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software\\nActive organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face,[331] Google,[332] EleutherAI and Meta.[333] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,[334][335] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.[336] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[337]\\n\\nFrameworks\\nArtificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:[338][339]\\n\\nRespect the dignity of individual people\\nConnect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively\\nCare for the wellbeing of everyone\\nProtect social values, justice, and the public interest\\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE\\'s Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;[340] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks.[341]\\nPromotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.[342]\\nThe UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called \\'Inspect\\' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[343]\\n\\nRegulation\\nMain articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence, Regulation of algorithms, and AI safety\\nThe first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation.\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[344] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[345] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[346][347] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[348] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[348] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[348] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[349] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[350] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics.[351] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation.[352] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[353]\\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".[346] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[354] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[355][356]\\nIn November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[357] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.[358][359] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.[360][361]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of artificial intelligence\\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence.\\nIn 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide.[362] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China.[362]\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.[363][364] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".[r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,[366] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943,[117] and Turing\\'s influential 1950 paper \\'Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.[367][364]\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[s][6] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[v][7] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[364]\\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[371] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[372] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation\\xa0... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\".[373] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[375] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects.[376] Minsky and Papert\\'s book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[377] The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[9]\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[378] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[10]\\nUp to this point, most of AI\\'s funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition,[379] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches.[380] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[x] Judea Pearl, Lotfi Zadeh, and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[87][385] But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[386] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[387]\\nAI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[388] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).[389]\\nHowever, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[68]\\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[11]\\nFor many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[y]\\nDeep learning\\'s success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[391] graphics processing units, cloud computing[392]) and access to large amounts of data[393] (including curated datasets,[392] such as ImageNet). Deep learning\\'s success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[348]\\n\\nThe number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022.\\nIn 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[325]\\nIn the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program taught only the game\\'s rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.[394] ChatGPT, launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[395] It marked what is widely regarded as AI\\'s breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness.[396] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".[397] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[398] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies.[399]\\n\\nPhilosophy\\nMain article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.[400] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.[401] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will.[402] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.[401]\\n\\nDefining artificial intelligence\\nSee also: Synthetic intelligence, Intelligent agent, Artificial mind, Virtual intelligence, and Dartmouth workshop\\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question \\'can machines think\\'?\"[403] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[403] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[367] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[404]\\n\\nThe Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior.[405]\\nRussell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.[1] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making \\'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\\'\"[406] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[407]\\nMcCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\".[408] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".[409] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\\nAnother definition has been adopted by Google,[410] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\nAs a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself[411] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses.[412] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term \\'AI\\' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms,[413] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".[414]\\nThere has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text.[415]\\n\\nEvaluating approaches to AI\\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\n\\nSymbolic AI and its limits\\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[417] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[418]\\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec\\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[419] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[420] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16]\\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[422][423] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\\nNeat vs. scruffy\\nMain article: Neats and scruffies\\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[424] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\\n\\nSoft vs. hard computing\\nMain article: Soft computing\\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\\n\\nNarrow vs. general AI\\nMain articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence\\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field\\'s long-term goals.[425][426] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\\n\\nMachine consciousness, sentience, and mind\\nMain articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness\\nThere is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[427] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\\n\\nConsciousness\\nMain articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind\\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[428] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[429]\\n\\nComputationalism and functionalism\\nMain articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind)\\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[430]\\nPhilosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[ac] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.[434]\\n\\nAI welfare and rights\\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.[435] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.[436][437] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.[436] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.[438]\\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[439] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own.[440][441]\\nProgress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.[437][436]\\n\\nFuture\\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[426] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".[442]\\nHowever, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[443]\\n\\nTranshumanism\\nMain article: Transhumanism\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[444]\\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.[445]\\n\\nIn fiction\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in fiction\\nThe word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title standing for \"Rossum\\'s Universal Robots\".\\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[446] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[447]\\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s and Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[448]\\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\" super-intelligent computer. Asimov\\'s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[449] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov\\'s laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[450]\\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[451]\\n\\nSee also\\nArtificial consciousness\\xa0– Field in cognitive science\\nArtificial intelligence and elections\\xa0– Use and impact of AI on political elections\\nArtificial intelligence content detection\\xa0– Software to detect AI-generated content\\nAssociation for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)\\nBehavior selection algorithm\\xa0– Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents\\nBusiness process automation\\xa0– Automation of business processes\\nCase-based reasoning\\xa0– Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems\\nComputational intelligence\\xa0– Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation\\nDigital immortality\\xa0– Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form\\nEmergent algorithm\\xa0– Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior\\nFemale gendering of AI technologies\\xa0– Gender biases in digital technologyPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\\nGlossary of artificial intelligence\\xa0– List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used in the study of artificial intelligence\\nIntelligence amplification\\xa0– Use of information technology to augment human intelligence\\nIntelligent agent\\xa0– Software agent which acts autonomously\\nIntelligent automation\\xa0– Software process that combines robotic process automation and artificial intelligence\\nList of artificial intelligence journals\\nList of artificial intelligence projects\\nMind uploading\\xa0– Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain\\nOrganoid intelligence – Use of brain cells and brain organoids for intelligent computing\\nRobotic process automation\\xa0– Form of business process automation technology\\nThe Last Day\\xa0– 1967 Welsh science fiction novel\\nWetware computer\\xa0– Computer composed of organic material\\nDARWIN EU - A European Union initiative coordinated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to generate and utilize real-world evidence (RWE) to support the evaluation and supervision of medicines across the EU.\\nExplanatory notes\\n\\n\\n^ a b This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998)\\n\\n^ a b This list of tools is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998)\\n\\n^ It is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge.[30][31]\\n\\n^ \\n\"Rational agent\" is general term used in economics, philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence.

But in the context of fairness, it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense.[261]\\n\\n^ Including Jon Kleinberg (Cornell University), Sendhil Mullainathan (University of Chicago), Cynthia Chouldechova (Carnegie Mellon) and Sam Corbett-Davis (Stanford)[270]\\n\\n^ Moritz Hardt (a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems) argues that machine learning \"is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you\\'re trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world.\"[275]\\n\\n^ When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision.\\n\\n^ This is the United Nations\\' definition, and includes things like land mines as well.[289]\\n\\n^ See table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the U.S. average.[300]\\n\\n^ Sometimes called a \"robopocalypse\"[308]\\n\\n^ \"Electronic brain\" was the term used by the press around this time.[363][365]\\n\\n^ \\nDaniel Crevier wrote, \"the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science.\"[368] Russell and Norvig called the conference \"the inception of artificial intelligence.\"[117]\\n\\n^ \\nRussell and Norvig wrote \"for the next 20 years the field would be dominated by these people and their students.\"[369]\\n\\n^ \\nRussell and Norvig wrote, \"it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish\".[370]\\n\\n^ \\nThe programs described are Arthur Samuel\\'s checkers program for the IBM 701, Daniel Bobrow\\'s STUDENT, Newell and Simon\\'s Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd\\'s SHRDLU.\\n\\n^ Russell and Norvig write: \"in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult problems\"[374]\\n\\n^ \\nEmbodied approaches to AI[381] were championed by Hans Moravec[382] and Rodney Brooks[383] and went by many names: Nouvelle AI.[383] Developmental robotics.[384]\\n\\n^ Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic: \"Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as natural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different methods, now they all use a programming method called \"deep learning\".

Exchange\\nNational Stock Exchange of India\\nOffices of Bursa Malaysia, Malaysia\\'s national stock exchange (known before demutualization as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange)\\nA stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies that are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Investments are usually made with an investment strategy in mind.\\n\\n\\nSize of the market\\nThe total market capitalization of all publicly traded stocks worldwide rose from US$2.5 trillion in 1980 to US$111 trillion by the end of 2023.[1]\\nAs of 2016[update], there are 60 stock exchanges in the world. Of these, there are 16 exchanges with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more, and they account for 87% of global market capitalization. Apart from the Australian Securities Exchange, these 16 exchanges are all in North America, Europe, or Asia.[2]\\nBy country, the largest stock markets as of January 2022 are in the United States of America (about 59.9%), followed by Japan (about 6.2%) and United Kingdom (about 3.9%).[3]\\n\\nStock exchange\\nMain article: Stock exchange\\nInterior hall of the Helsinki Stock Exchange in Helsinki, Finland, 1965\\nA stock exchange is an exchange (or bourse) where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares (equity stock), bonds, and other securities. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. These and other stocks may also be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.[4]\\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed-interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives, which are more likely to be traded OTC.\\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. Equities (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual stock investors to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include banks, insurance companies, pension funds and hedge funds. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange trader.\\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as open outcry. This method is used in some stock exchanges and commodities exchanges, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the NASDAQ.\\nA potential buyer bids a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller asks a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling at the Market means you will accept any ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a marketplace. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating price discovery.\\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a hybrid market for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the trading floor. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a floor broker, who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated market maker (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM\\'s job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a bid–ask spread exists, no trade immediately takes place – in this case, the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for program trading.\\nThe NASDAQ is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ market makers will always provide a bid and ask the price at which they will always purchase or sell \\'their\\' stock.\\nThe Paris Bourse, now part of Euronext, is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. Stockbrokers met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the CATS trading system was introduced, and the order matching system was fully automated.\\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are Instinet, and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the commissions of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as adverse selection.[5] Financial regulators have probed dark pools.[6][7]\\n\\nMarket participant\\nThe examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this section, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new section, as appropriate. (November 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\\nMarket participants include individual retail investors, institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, index funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, investor groups, banks and various other financial institutions), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares. Robo-advisors, which automate investment for individuals are also major participants.\\n\\nStock market participation post-2020 pandemic\\nIn 2021, the value of world stock markets experienced an increase of 26.5%, amounting to US$22.3 trillion. Developing economies contributed US$9.9 trillion and developed economies US$12.4 trillion. Asia and Oceania accounted for 45%, Europe had 37%, and America had 16%, while Africa had 2% of the global market.[8]\\n\\nStock market participation factors\\nFactors such as high trading prices, market ratings, information about stock exchange dynamics, and financial institutions can influence individual and corporate participation in stock markets. Additionally, the appeal of stock ownership, driven by the potential for higher returns compared to other financial instruments, plays a crucial role in attracting individuals to invest in the stock market.\\nRegional and country-specific factors can also impact stock market participation rates. For example, in the United States, stock market participation rates vary widely across states, with regional factors potentially influencing these disparities. It is noted that individual participation costs alone cannot explain such large differences in participation rates from state to state, indicating the presence of other regional factors at play.[9]\\nBehavioral factors are recognized as significant influences on stock market participation, as evidenced by the low participation rates observed in the Ghanaian stock market.[10]\\nFactors such as factor endowments, geography, political stability, liberal trade policies, foreign direct investment inflows, and domestic industrial capacity are also identified as important in determining participation.[11]\\n\\nDemographics of market participation\\nIndirect vs. Direct Investment\\nIndirect investment involves owning shares indirectly, such as via a mutual fund or an exchange traded fund. Direct investment involves direct ownership of shares.[12]\\nDirect ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000.[13][14] Indirect participation in the form of retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time.[13][14] Rydqvist, Spizman, and Strebulaev attribute the differential growth in direct and indirect holdings to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way, the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.[15]\\n\\nParticipation by income and wealth strata\\nRates of participation and the value of holdings differ significantly across strata of income. In the bottom quintile of income, 5.5% of households directly own stock and 10.7% hold stocks indirectly in the form of retirement accounts.[14] The top decile of income has a direct participation rate of 47.5% and an indirect participation rate in the form of retirement accounts of 89.6%.[14] The median value of directly owned stock in the bottom quintile of income is $4,000 and is $78,600 in the top decile of income as of 2007.[16] The median value of indirectly held stock in the form of retirement accounts for the same two groups in the same year is $6,300 and $214,800 respectively.[16] Since the Great Recession of 2008 households in the bottom half of the income distribution have lessened their participation rate both directly and indirectly from 53.2% in 2007 to 48.8% in 2013, while over the same period households in the top decile of the income distribution slightly increased participation 91.7% to 92.1%.[17] The mean value of direct and indirect holdings at the bottom half of the income distribution moved slightly downward from $53,800 in 2007 to $53,600 in 2013.[17] In the top decile, mean value of all holdings fell from $982,000 to $969,300 in the same time.[17] The mean value of all stock holdings across the entire income distribution is valued at $269,900 as of 2013.[17]\\n\\nParticipation by race and gender\\nThe racial composition of stock market ownership shows households headed by whites are nearly four and six times as likely to directly own stocks than households headed by blacks and Hispanics respectively. As of 2011 the national rate of direct participation was 19.6%, for white households the participation rate was 24.5%, for black households it was 6.4% and for Hispanic households it was 4.3%. Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female-headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.[14]\\n\\nDeterminants and possible explanations of stock market participation\\nIn a 2003 paper by Vissing-Jørgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing. Her research concludes that a fixed cost of $200 per year is sufficient to explain why nearly half of all U.S. households do not participate in the market.[18] Participation rates have been shown to strongly correlate with education levels, promoting the hypothesis that information and transaction costs of market participation are better absorbed by more educated households. Behavioral economists Harrison Hong, Jeffrey Kubik and Jeremy Stein suggest that sociability and participation rates of communities have a statistically significant impact on an individual\\'s decision to participate in the market. Their research indicates that social individuals living in states with higher than average participation rates are 5% more likely to participate than individuals that do not share those characteristics.[19] This phenomenon also explained in cost terms. Knowledge of market functioning diffuses through communities and consequently lowers transaction costs associated with investing.\\n\\nHistory\\nIn 12th-century France, the courtiers de change were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first brokers. The Italian historian Lodovico Guicciardini described how, in late 13th-century Bruges, commodity traders gathered outdoors at a market square containing an inn owned by a family called Van der Beurze, and in 1409 they became the \"Brugse Beurse\", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting.[20] The idea quickly spread around Flanders and neighboring countries and \"Beurzen\" soon opened in Ghent and Rotterdam. International traders, and specially the Italian bankers, present in Bruges since the early 13th-century, took back the word in their countries to define the place for stock market exchange: first the Italians (Borsa), but soon also the French (Bourse), the Germans (börse), Russians (birža), Czechs (burza), Swedes (börs), Danes and Norwegians (børs). In most languages, the word coincides with that for money bag, dating back to the Latin bursa, from which obviously also derives the name of the Van der Beurse family.\\nIn the middle of the 13th century, Venetian bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in Pisa, Verona, Genoa and Florence also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century. Around this time, a joint stock company—one whose stock is owned jointly by the shareholders—emerged and became important for the colonization of what Europeans called the \"New World\".[21]\\n\\nOne of the oldest known stock certificates, issued by the VOC chamber of Enkhuizen, dated September 9, 1606\\nCrowd gathering on Wall Street (New York City) after the 1929 crash, one of the worst stock market crashes in history\\nThere are now stock markets in virtually every developed and most developing economies, with the world\\'s largest markets being in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, India, China, Canada, Germany, France, South Korea and the Netherlands.[22]\\n\\nImportance\\nEven in the days before perestroika, socialism was never a monolith. Within the Communist countries, the spectrum of socialism ranged from the quasi-market, quasi-syndicalist system of Yugoslavia to the centralized totalitarianism of neighboring Albania. One time I asked Professor von Mises, the great expert on the economics of socialism, at what point on this spectrum of statism would he designate a country as \"socialist\" or not. At that time, I wasn\\'t sure that any definite criterion existed to make that sort of clear-cut judgment. And so I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity and decisiveness of Mises\\'s answer. \"A stock market,\" he answered promptly. \"A stock market is crucial to the existence of capitalism and private property. For it means that there is a functioning market in the exchange of private titles to the means of production. There can be no genuine private ownership of capital without a stock market: there can be no true socialism if such a market is allowed to exist.\"—\\u200aMurray Rothbard, in \"Making Economic Sense\" (2006)[23]\\nFunction and purpose\\nThe stock market is one of the most important ways for companies to raise money, along with debt markets which are generally more imposing but do not trade publicly.[24] This allows businesses to be publicly traded, and raise additional financial capital for expansion by selling shares of ownership of the company in a public market. The liquidity that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as property and other immoveable assets.\\nHistory has shown that the price of stocks and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to be an up-and-coming economy. The stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country\\'s economic strength and development.[25]\\nRising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, central banks tend to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of financial system functions. Financial stability is the raison d\\'être of central banks.[26]\\nExchanges also act as the clearinghouse for each transaction, meaning that they collect and deliver the shares, and guarantee payment to the seller of a security. This eliminates the risk to an individual buyer or seller that the counterparty could default on the transaction.[27]\\nThe smooth functioning of all these activities facilitates economic growth in that lower costs and enterprise risks promote the production of goods and services as well as possibly employment. In this way the financial system is assumed to contribute to increased prosperity, although some controversy exists as to whether the optimal financial system is bank-based or market-based.[28]\\nEvents such as the 2008 financial crisis have prompted a heightened degree of scrutiny of the impact of the structure of stock markets[29][30] (called market microstructure), in particular to the stability of the financial system and the transmission of systemic risk.[31]\\n\\nRelation to the modern financial system\\nA transformation is the move to electronic trading to replace human trading of listed securities.[30]\\n\\nBehavior of stock prices\\nNASDAQ in Times Square, New York City\\nSee also: Behavioral economics\\nChanges in stock prices are mostly caused by external factors such as socioeconomic conditions, inflation, exchange rates. Intellectual capital does not affect a company stock\\'s current earnings. Intellectual capital contributes to a stock\\'s return growth.[32]\\nThe efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information at the current time.\\nThe \\'hard\\' efficient-market hypothesis does not explain the cause of events such as the crash in 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 22.6 percent—the largest-ever one-day fall in the United States.[33]\\nThis event demonstrated that share prices can fall dramatically even though no generally agreed upon definite cause has been found: a thorough search failed to detect any \\'reasonable\\' development that might have accounted for the crash. (Such events are predicted to occur strictly by randomness, although very rarely.) It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur \\'randomly\\') are not occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.[33]\\nA \\'soft\\' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants cannot systematically profit from any momentary \\'market anomaly\\'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e. non-trending)[dubious – discuss],[34] many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and value at risk limits, theoretically could cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian[35] (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).[36][37]\\nOther research has shown that psychological factors may result in exaggerated (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors \\'cancel out\\'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to \\'seeing\\' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just noise, e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context, this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors\\' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.[38]\\nAnother phenomenon—also from psychology—that works against an objective assessment is group thinking. As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group. An example with which one may be familiar is the reluctance to enter a restaurant that is empty; people generally prefer to have their opinion validated by those of others in the group.\\nIn one paper the authors draw an analogy with gambling.[39] In normal times the market behaves like a game of roulette; the probabilities are known and largely independent of the investment decisions of the different players. In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.[40]\\nStock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively.\\nEconomic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends. Macroeconomic trends include such as changes in GDP, unemployment rates, national income, price indices, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, saving, investment, energy, international trade, immigration, productivity, aging populations, innovations, international finance.[41] increasing corporate profit, increasing profit margins, higher concentration of business, lower company income, less vigorous activity, less progress, lower investment rates, lower productivity growth, less employee share of corporate revenues,[42] decreasing Worker to Beneficiary ratio (year 1960 5:1, year 2009 3:1, year 2030 2.2:1),[43] increasing female to male ratio college graduates.[44]\\n\\nIrrational behavior\\nSometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself.[45] However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counter reaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected. Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, euphoria and mass panic.\\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or bought by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave irrationally when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.[46] However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\\n\\nCrashes\\nMain article: Stock market crash\\nFurther information: List of stock market crashes and bear markets\\nRobert Shiller\\'s plot of the S&P Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates, from Irrational Exuberance, 2d ed.[47] In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns, \"The stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average... People still place too much confidence in the markets and have too strong a belief that paying attention to the gyrations in their investments will someday make them rich, and so they do not make conservative preparations for possible bad outcomes.\"\\nPrice-Earnings ratios as a predictor of twenty-year returns based upon the plot by Robert Shiller (Figure 10.1).[47] The horizontal axis shows the real price-earnings ratio of the S&P Composite Stock Price Index as computed in Irrational Exuberance (inflation adjusted price divided by the prior ten-year mean of inflation-adjusted earnings). The vertical axis shows the geometric average real annual return on investing in the S&P Composite Stock Price Index, reinvesting dividends, and selling twenty years later. Data from different twenty-year periods is color-coded as shown in the key. Shiller states that this plot \"confirms that long-term investors—investors who commit their money to an investment for ten full years—did do well when prices were low relative to earnings at the beginning of the ten years. Long-term investors would be well advised, individually, to lower their exposure to the stock market when it is high, as it has been recently, and get into the market when it is low.\"[47]\\nA stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in share prices of stocks listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public\\'s loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative economic bubbles.\\nThere have been famous stock market crashes that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the social security and retirement plans are being increasingly privatized and linked to stocks and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the stock market crash of 1973–4, the Black Monday of 1987, the Dot-com bubble of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\\n\\n1929\\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the Great Depression.\\n\\n1987\\nAnother famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 – Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history – the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28–29, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday—the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles – main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the theory of rational human conduct, the theory of market equilibrium and the efficient-market hypothesis. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the Federal Reserve System and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of a financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\\n\\n2007–2009\\nThis marked the beginning of the Great Recession. Starting in 2007 and lasting through 2009, financial markets experienced one of the sharpest declines in decades. It was more widespread than just the stock market as well. The housing market, lending market, and even global trade experienced unimaginable decline. Sub-prime lending led to the housing bubble bursting and was made famous by movies like The Big Short where those holding large mortgages were unwittingly falling prey to lenders. This saw banks and major financial institutions completely fail in many cases and took major government intervention to remedy during the period. From October 2007 to March 2009, the S&P 500 fell 57% and wouldn\\'t recover to its 2007 levels until April 2013.\\n\\n2020\\nThe 2020 stock market crash was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began on February 20, 2020, and ended on April 7. This market crash was due to the sudden outbreak of the global pandemic, COVID-19. The crash ended with a new deal that had a positive impact on the market.[48]\\n\\nCircuit breakers\\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic \\'matching engines\\' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.[49]\\n\\nNew York Stock Exchange (NYSE) circuit breakers[50][51]\\n\\n\\n% drop in S&P 500 Index\\n\\nTrading Halt\\n\\n\\n7%\\n\\nTrading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m\\n\\n\\n13%\\n\\nTrading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25\\xa0p.m.\\n\\n\\n20%\\n\\nTrading will stop for the day\\n\\nStock market index\\nMain article: Stock market index\\nUS Stock Market Value by Sector\\nThe movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the S&P, the FTSE, the Euronext indices and the NIFTY & SENSEX of India. Such indices are usually market capitalization weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\\n\\nDerivative instruments\\nMain article: Derivative (finance)\\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stock index and stock options, equity swaps, single-stock futures, and stock index futures. These last two may be traded on futures exchanges (which are distinct from stock exchanges—their history traces back to commodity futures exchanges), or traded over-the-counter. As all of these products are only derived from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) derivatives market, rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\\n\\nLeveraged strategies\\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using short selling; margin buying may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, derivatives may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\\n\\nShort selling\\nMain article: Short selling\\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of naked shorting is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\\n\\nMargin buying\\nMain article: margin buying\\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks\\' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor\\'s account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account\\'s equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the Federal Reserve) was implemented after the Crash of 1929. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total investment represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of free-riding: putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\\n\\nTypes of financial markets\\nFinancial markets can be divided into different subtypes:\\n\\nFor the assets transferred\\nMoney market\\xa0: It is traded with money or financial assets with short-term maturity and high liquidity, generally assets with a term of less than one year.\\nCapital market\\xa0: Financial assets with medium and long-term maturity are traded, which are basic for carrying out certain investment processes.\\nDepending on its structure\\nOrganized market\\nNon-organized markets denominated in English (Over The Counter or OTC).\\nAccording to the negotiation phase of financial assets\\nPrimary market\\xa0: Financial assets are created. In this market, assets are transmitted directly by their issuer.\\nSecondary market\\xa0: Only existing financial assets are exchanged, which were issued at a previous time. This market allows holders of financial assets to sell instruments that were already issued in the primary market (or that had already been transmitted in the secondary market) and that are in their possession, or to buy other financial assets.\\nAccording to the geographical perspective\\nNational markets. The currency in which the financial assets are denominated and the residence of those involved is national.\\nInternational markets. The markets situated outside a country\\'s geographical area.\\nAccording to the type of asset traded\\nTraditional market. In which financial assets such as demand deposits, stocks or bonds are traded.\\nAlternative market. In which alternative financial assets are traded such as portfolio investments, promissory notes, factoring, real estate (e.g. through fiduciary rights), in private equity funds, venture capital funds, hedge funds, investment projects (e.g. infrastructure, cinema, etc.) among many others.\\nOther markets\\nCommodity markets, which allow the trading of commodities.\\nDerivatives markets, which provide instruments for managing financial risk.\\nForward markets, which provide standardized forward contracts to trade products at a future date.\\nInsurance markets, which allows the redistribution of varied risks.\\nForeign exchange market, which allows the exchange of foreign currencies.\\nStock market and foreign exchange market\\nWhile the stock market is the marketplace for buying and selling company stocks, the foreign exchange market, also known as forex or FX, is the global marketplace for the purchase and sale of national currencies. It serves several functions, including facilitating currency conversions, managing foreign exchange risk through futures and forwards, and providing a platform for speculative investors to earn a profit on FX trading. The market includes various types of products, such as the spot market, futures market, forward market, swap market, and options market. For example, the spot market involves the immediate buying and selling of currencies, while the forward market allows for the buying and selling of currencies at an agreed exchange rate, with the actual exchange taking place at a future delivery date. The foreign exchange market is needed for facilitating global trade, including investments, the exchange of goods and services, and financial transactions, and it is considered one of the largest markets in the global economy.[52][53]\\n\\nElectronic trading market\\nThe electronic trading market refers to the digital marketplace where financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and derivatives are bought and sold through online platforms. This market operates via electronic trading platforms, also known as online trading platforms, which are software applications that enable the trading of financial products over a network, typically through a financial intermediary. Platforms, such as eToro, Plus500, Robinhood, and AvaTrade serve as a digital medium for trading financial instruments and make financial markets more accessible, allowing individual investors to participate in trading without the need for traditional brokers or substantial capital. They also provide features such as real-time market data, stock price analysis, research reports, and news updates, which support decision-making in trading activities.[54]\\nThese platforms often incorporate systems, such as the Martingale Trading System, used in forex trading. Additionally, online trading has evolved to include mobile trading apps, enabling transactions to be conducted remotely via smartphones.[55]\\n\\nInvestment strategies\\nMain articles: Investment strategy, Stock market prediction, and Investment management\\nMany strategies can be classified as either fundamental analysis or technical analysis. Fundamental analysis refers to analyzing companies by their financial statements found in SEC filings, business trends, and general economic conditions. Technical analysis studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company\\'s financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the Trend following method, used by John W. Henry and Ed Seykota, which uses price patterns and is also rooted in risk management and diversification.\\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive index funds. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the S&P 500 Index or Wilshire 5000). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of fundamental analysis only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. Socially responsible investing is another investment preference.\\n\\nAnnual stock market growth\\nThe average annual growth rate of the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500 index, has historically been around 10%.[56] This figure represents the long-term average return and is often cited as a benchmark for assessing the performance of the stock market as a whole.\\nThe market\\'s results from one year to the next may vary substantially from the long-term average. For instance, in 2012–2021, the S&P 500 index had an average annual return of 14.8%.[57] However, individual annual returns can fluctuate widely, with some years experiencing negative growth and others seeing substantial gains.\\nWhile the average stock market return is around 10% per year, there is also the impact of inflation, resulting in investors\\' losing purchasing power of 2% to 3% every year due to it, which reduces the real rate of return on investments.[58]\\n\\nTaxation\\nTaxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a capital gains tax. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as \"double taxation\".\\n\\nStock market scams\\nMain articles: 1992 Indian stock market scam, Harshad Mehta, Ketan Parekh, and NSE co-location scam\\nThe examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with India and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject.

This approach focuses on step-by-step transformation instead of the all-or-nothing approach. A few benefits of DDP are risk mitigation, quick response to changing market conditions, and increased success rate to digital transformations.[9]\\n\\n\\nBenefits, barriers and enablers[edit]\\nBenefits[edit]\\nAdopting digital technology can bring various benefits to a business.[10][11] CIPS has also observed that digital capability can be used to support supply chain transparency and remote working.[6]\\n\\nBarriers[edit]\\nThere are multiple common barriers that digital transformation initiatives, projects and strategies face. One of the main barriers is change management, because changes in processes may face active resistance from workers. Related to change management is the miscommunication between workers, which can lead to implementation delays or even complete project failure. Some companies are unable to develop a realistic cost projection due to a too optimistic view of the process. Companies may have legacy systems in place, which can lead to integration difficulties with new systems. Within organizations there may also be a lack of resources, top management support, workers\\' skills, commitment, collaboration and vision.[12]\\nSome company cultures can struggle with the changes required by digital transformation.[13]\\n\\nEnablers[edit]\\nIn addition to the several barriers to digital transformation, there are also numerous enablers of digital transformation. The primary enablers are organizations\\' resources and capabilities, workers\\' skills, technologies and culture. The aforementioned enabler \"Organizations resources and capabilities\" refers to the ability of an organization to adapt to contemporary issues arising in the business environment, as well as their capabilities in the field of data analytics. In regards to \"Workers\\' skills\", workers must be able to develop valuable insights with the use of data, have significant emotional intelligence and effectively part-take in the development of new products. Thirdly, technology is also a vital enabler of digital transformation. Companies can benefit from having access to artificial intelligence, data analytics softwares and effective usage of social media. Lastly, \"Culture\" pertains to the extent the organizational culture is data-driven and the quality of the top management support and engagement within the corporation.[12]\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nDigitization is the process of converting analog information into digital form using an analog-to-digital converter, such as in an image scanner or for digital audio recordings. As usage of the internet has increased since the 1990s, the usage of digitization has also increased. Digital transformation, however, is broader than just the digitization of existing processes. Digital transformation entails considering how products, processes and organizations can be changed through the use of new digital technologies.[14][15] A 2019 review proposes a definition of digital transformation as \"a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies\".[2] Digital transformation can be seen as a socio-technical programme.[16][17]\\nA 2015 report stated that maturing digital companies were using cloud hosting, social media, mobile devices and data analytics, while other companies were using individual technologies for specific problems.[18] By 2017, one study found that less than 40% of industries had become digitized (although usage was high in the media, retail and technology industries).[19]\\nAs of 2020, 37% of European companies and 27% of American companies had not embraced digital technology.[20][21] Over the period of 2017 to 2020, 70% of European municipalities have increased their spending on digital technologies.[20][22] By 2019, the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply found in a survey of 700 managers, representing over 20 industries and 55 countries, that over 90% of the businesses represented had adopted at least one new form of information technology, and 90% stated that their digitalisation strategies aimed to secure decreased operational costs and increased efficiency.[23]\\nIn a 2021 survey, 55% of European companies stated the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for digital technology, and 46% of companies reported that they have grown more digital.[24] Half of these companies anticipate an increase in the usage of digital technologies in the future, with a greater proportion being companies that have previously used digital technology.[25][26] A lack of digital infrastructure was viewed as a key barrier to investment by 16% of EU businesses, compared to 5% in the US.[20]\\nIn a survey conducted in 2021, 89% of African banks polled claimed that the pandemic had hastened the digital transformation of their internal operations.[27]\\nIn 2022, 53% of businesses in the EU reported taking action or making investments in becoming more digital.[28][29][30] 71% of companies in the US reported using at least one advanced digital technology, similar to the average usage of 69% across EU organizations.[28][31][32]\\n\\nTOP Framework[edit]\\nDigital transformation plays a crucial role in alleviating the adverse effects of simultaneous and interconnected challenges, while also strengthening the resilience and adaptability of both organizations and supply chains. Represented by the TOP framework, digital transformation acts as a catalyst for generating and leveraging benefits. These benefits hold the potential to bolster resilience across not only individual organizations but also throughout the entire supply chain.[12]\\n\\nTechnology[edit]\\nIt does so by leveraging cutting-edge technologies to enhance predictive power and responsiveness. Technologies include the Internet of Things, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, simulation, additive manufacturing, blockchain, and digital twins.[12]\\n\\nOrganization[edit]\\nDigital transformation embedded within the organizational culture empowers managers to take decisive actions, enables seamless collaboration among workers across diverse departments, and fortifies supply chains. Additionally, it empowers top management to respond swiftly and proactively, effectively reducing and mitigating adverse impacts.[12]\\n\\nPeople[edit]\\nEffective communication within an organization is essential among departments and employees. Furthermore, possessing robust skills in communication, leadership, and strategy is imperative for overcoming any adverse effects of the challenges.[12]\\n\\nRole of resources and capabilities[edit]\\nAccording to the resource-based view theory, successful firms\\' resources should be\\xa0valuable, rare, non-imitable, and non-substitutable[33] in order for capabilities such as responsiveness, flexibility, or even agility to be developed. \"A capability is a concept that refers to an organization\\'s use of a set of resources to carry out its routine and strategic activities\".[34]\\nThe digital transformation capability (DTC) framework is a direct application of this theory, stating that resources can be either tangible, intangible or human. The tangible side of the DTC framework gathers physical assets like the organization\\'s IT infrastructure, whereas the intangible side focuses on its digital transformation strategy, knowledge, and reputational capital. Human resources are broader and include technical skills, continuous training, leadership, and social skills.[12]\\n\\nSustainability and digital transformation[edit]\\nMain article: Digital technologies and environmental sustainability\\nDigital transformation is often perceived as a reactive measure to address customer demands, competition, and regulatory compliance. However, it can be a proactive opportunity for organizations to achieve sustainable business practices and facilitate a circular economy. By building sensing, smart, sustainable, and social capabilities, enterprises can capture valuable information, make faster and smarter decisions, and adapt to changing environments.[35]\\nAligning digital transformation with sustainability can enhance performance by engaging stakeholders, optimizing resource allocation, and reducing risks. A comprehensive business case that prioritizes sustainability benefits and multidimensional returns can secure the necessary resources for successful implementation. To achieve sustainability goals, effective governance, integration, change management, and stakeholder involvement are critical factors.[36]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nE-learning\\nElectronic medical record\\nGovernment Digital Service\\nOnline shopping\\nReal estate\\nSupply chain\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ a b Mirzagayeva, Shamiya; Aslanov, Heydar (2022-12-15). \"The digitalization process: what has it led to, and what can we expect in the future?\" (PDF).

Fundamental analysis refers to analyzing companies by their financial statements found in SEC filings, business trends, and general economic conditions. Technical analysis studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company\\'s financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the Trend following method, used by John W. Henry and Ed Seykota, which uses price patterns and is also rooted in risk management and diversification.\\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive index funds. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the S&P 500 Index or Wilshire 5000). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of fundamental analysis only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. Socially responsible investing is another investment preference.\\n\\nAnnual stock market growth\\nThe average annual growth rate of the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500 index, has historically been around 10%.[56] This figure represents the long-term average return and is often cited as a benchmark for assessing the performance of the stock market as a whole.\\nThe market\\'s results from one year to the next may vary substantially from the long-term average. For instance, in 2012–2021, the S&P 500 index had an average annual return of 14.8%.[57] However, individual annual returns can fluctuate widely, with some years experiencing negative growth and others seeing substantial gains.\\nWhile the average stock market return is around 10% per year, there is also the impact of inflation, resulting in investors\\' losing purchasing power of 2% to 3% every year due to it, which reduces the real rate of return on investments.[58]\\n\\nTaxation\\nTaxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a capital gains tax. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as \"double taxation\".\\n\\nStock market scams\\nMain articles: 1992 Indian stock market scam, Harshad Mehta, Ketan Parekh, and NSE co-location scam\\nThe examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with India and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this section, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new section, as appropriate. (September 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\\nThe Indian stock exchanges, Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India, have been rocked by several high-profile corruption scandals.[59][60] At times, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred various individuals and entities from trading on the exchanges for stock manipulation, especially in illiquid small-cap and penny stocks.[61][62][63]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nAsset allocation\\nDiversification (finance)\\nEquity crowdfunding\\nList of stock exchange trading hours\\nList of stock market crashes and bear markets\\nList of stock exchanges\\nList of stock market indices\\nModeling and analysis of financial markets\\nFinancial risk management\\nSecurities market participants (United States)\\nSecurities regulation in the United States\\nStock market crash\\nStock market crashes in India\\nStock market bubble\\nStock market cycles\\nStock market data systems\\nStandard deviation\\nRisk management\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ \"FY 2023 Market Highlights\" (PDF).

Some examples are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stock index and stock options, equity swaps, single-stock futures, and stock index futures. These last two may be traded on futures exchanges (which are distinct from stock exchanges—their history traces back to commodity futures exchanges), or traded over-the-counter. As all of these products are only derived from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) derivatives market, rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\\n\\nLeveraged strategies\\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using short selling; margin buying may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, derivatives may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\\n\\nShort selling\\nMain article: Short selling\\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of naked shorting is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\\n\\nMargin buying\\nMain article: margin buying\\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks\\' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor\\'s account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account\\'s equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the Federal Reserve) was implemented after the Crash of 1929. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total investment represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of free-riding: putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\\n\\nTypes of financial markets\\nFinancial markets can be divided into different subtypes:')]"

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1]\\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3]\\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[4] Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta,[5] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[12] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI\\'s ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI\\'s long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.'),\n",

The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[325]\\nIn the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program taught only the game\\'s rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.[394] ChatGPT, launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[395] It marked what is widely regarded as AI\\'s breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness.[396] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".[397] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[398] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies.[399]\\n\\nPhilosophy\\nMain article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.[400] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.[401] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will.[402] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.[401]\\n\\nDefining artificial intelligence\\nSee also: Synthetic intelligence, Intelligent agent, Artificial mind, Virtual intelligence, and Dartmouth workshop\\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question \\'can machines think\\'?\"[403] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[403] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[367] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[404]')]"
